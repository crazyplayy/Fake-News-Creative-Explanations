Claim:  North Carolina is in the small minority of states that requires an absentee ballot to be signed two witnesses or a notary public.  
Label: true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/23/jay-chaudhuri/nc-absentee-ballots-require-2-witnesses-unique/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Jay Chaudhuri and Natasha Marcus, North Carolina state Senators, want to make it easier for people to vote absentee by mail.
In an op-ed, they claim that NC is in the "small minority" of states that require two witnesses to sign an absentee ballot.
That's true. NC is one of only three states that require the ballots to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isn't available.
 
Poem: 
Nobody likes
The COVID pandemic.
To know that you don't have to be
A brilliant academic.

But it's hard to not get infected with
The COVID pandemic
When you can't absentee vote
Because the process is very bureaucratic.

Two of the NC senators
Want to make it easier
"Let's vote like almost every other state!", they say
So the process can be breezier.

Claim:  OSHA says masks don t work to reduce COVID-19 transmission and violate OSHA oxygen levels.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/25/facebook-posts/no-osha-does-not-say-masks-dont-work-against-covid/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 OSHA recommends that masks be worn to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Masks aren’t a cure to prevent spread of COVID-19, experts say. But they are an effective tool in slowing transmission.
 
Poem: 
OSHA doesn't know
About the masked people oxygen levels,
But if it is certain of anything
It's how to fight these respiratory virus devils.

OSHA has confirmed: masks may slow it, 
But they alone won't cease the COVID-19 transmission!
To stop you from infecting your loved ones,
That's the masks real mission.

Claim:  In West Virginia alone, overdoses have increased 50% during the #COVID-19 pandemic.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/19/carol-miller/have-overdoses-wva-increased-50-during-pandemic/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  West Virginia has seen an overdose spike during the pandemic.
 For the period from April through June, responses by emergency medical services for suspected overdoses rose 33% compared to the same period a year earlier. But for May and June alone, the number rose 47%, which is close to the 50% Miller cited.
 
Poem: 
An hyperbole was used to emphasize a point for effect,
According to Miss Miller
West Virginia people are overdosing
Now more than ever.

Might not be 100% true, but it was a good attention call
For the social strike
That is COVID causing
A WV pandemic overdose spike!

Claim:  Gates Foundation stands to make nearly £31.5 billion on a coronavirus vaccine in U.K.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/14/facebook-posts/no-evidence-gates-foundation-will-profit-coronavir/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The £31.5 billion figure was calculated by multiplying an estimated cost per vaccine times the population of the United Kingdom. The estimated vaccine cost comes from a Daily Mail story, but we could find no other evidence to back it up.
The Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the charity stands to profit from them.
The source of the Facebook post is a website that has published false conspiracy theories in the past.
 
Poem:
A lot of people have
Shady and nasty hidden agendas.
Getting your facts and info on false conspiracies websites
is not very recommended.

Bill Gates and his foundation
Are both pretty rich,
But there's no proof they're profiting
By selling UK vaccines.

Claim:  Says researchers found a fabric that kills coronaviruses  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/30/facebook-posts/research-fabric-can-neutralize-coronavirus-masks/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 “Electroceutical fabric” was developed in 2017 as an antimicrobial wound dressing, but a new study shows it is also effective at neutralizing coronaviruses.
The makers are seeking FDA emergency approval to use it for COVID-19 face masks.
Metal embedded in the fabric creates an electric current that stops the virus from assembling and attaching to the host after a minute of exposure to the electrical field.
These findings are in a preliminary study that has not yet gone through the peer-review process.
 
Poem: 
Researchers work very hard
Some of them to make the world a better place,
But celebrating too early
Might end up in disgrace.

An “electroceutical fabric” was invented in 2017,
To fight microbial fuddy-duddy
But if it can successfully stop COVID-19
It's still a preliminary study.
