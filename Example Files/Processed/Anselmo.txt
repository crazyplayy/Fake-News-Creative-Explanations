Claim:  The media is pretty quiet about Florida s decline in COVID cases. No mask mandates or vaccine mandates.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/oct/15/instagram-posts/media-reported-weeks-drop-florida-covid-19-cases-w/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 News media have reported for weeks on the recent decline in COVID-19 cases in Florida.
Florida does have measures that restrict mask mandates in schools and limit requirements to show proof of vaccination. But the decline in cases occurred only after Florida led the nation, and Florida still ranks among states with the highest case rate.
 
Poem: 

"Joey Saldino decided to spill
Some misinformation
In an attempt to screw with the COVID efforts
Of an entire nation.

COVID cases in Florida have been declining
And the media have reported about it,
But that's due to Florida's COVID measures shining
And it's still worse than the rest of the country."

Claim:  Pfizer Confirms COVID-Vaccinated People Can ‘Shed’ Spike Proteins And Harm The Unvaccinated  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/08/blog-posting/repeatedly-debunked-idea-shedding-covid-19-vaccine/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  People vaccinated against COVID-19 cannot shed spike proteins to harm anyone. 
 Claims about COVID-19 vaccine shedding began spreading in April and have been debunked many times. 
 Pfizer never confirmed that COVID-19 vaccine shedding is possible. 

 
Poem: 

There's no information source
On which you can blindly depend.
Getting Pfizer info on false conspiracies blogs
is certainly not to recommend.

Vaccine shedding can't occur on mRNA vaccines
Which are the ones used for COVID on the USA nation.
Also "America’s Frontline Doctors"
Is not a trustful organization.

Claim:  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wore a Nazi cross symbol.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/25/facebook-posts/zelenskys-shirt-bears-emblem-ukraine-armed-forces-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 An Iron Cross visible on some of Zelensky’s military green T-shirts is not a Nazi symbol. It represents the official emblem of Ukraine’s armed forces and includes the country’s coat of arms in the center.
The Iron Cross is a commonly used, famous German military medal. It’s not a hate symbol on its own. It was turned into a Nazi symbol when the regime superimposed a swastika in the center.
 
Poem: 

Iron Cross is a symbol, 
a swastika a hateful one.
Zelensky wore an emblem,
in which you can rely upon.
the nazi symbol means death
but ukrainians just want to stop bloodshed
