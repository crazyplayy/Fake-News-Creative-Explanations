Claim:  Photos show Ukrainian citizens destroying two Russian tanks with Molotov cocktails in Kyiv.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/02/facebook-posts/these-photos-molotov-cocktails-are-2014-protests-k/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Four photos showing scenes of fire, billowing smoke and people engaged in a fight date back to 2014 anti-government protests in Ukraine.
 
Poem: 
Ukraine is indeed in a conflict
From which there is a tone of evidence.
They're getting attacked
Without much benevolence.

People have to ponder
where they get their information,
Because old 2014 photos of ukranian protests is nothing
But war prograpanda for the world population.

Claim:  Says remdesivir is responsible for killing patients hospitalized with COVID-19.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/10/nicole-sirotek/no-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-werent-killed-re/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 An early study in 2020 showed that remdesivir used to treat COVID-19 resulted in little to no improvement. 
Later studies found the drug was effective, including one that found an 87% lower risk of hospitalization or death.
No studies have found that remdesivir was responsible for killing COVID-19 patients.
Medical experts explained that remdesivir is given to patients who are at the highest risk of death because of the severity of their disease.
 
Poem: 
Science is always progressing
Old facts can become today's fake information.
That's why the world can't stop doing
Scientific investigation.

Early studies deemed remdesivir useless
But it ain't used to kill people in hospitalization.
Turns out it kind of is
Going to die by COVID people's salvation.

Claim:  Ron DeSantis let millions of COVID-19 tests expire.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/04/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-overstates-claim-about-millions-expi/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Crist overstated the number of expired tests, it was up to 1 million, not “millions.”
Crist’s statement leaves the impression that the tests were no longer usable. 
However, because the tests were stored safely, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed the tests to be used by March 2022.
DeSantis attributed their expiration to lack of demand and to pending approvals from the federal government. 
Before Florida could distribute the tests, the FDA had to sign off on their safety.
 
Poem: 
Crist tried to exagerate the facts
To mess with his opposition,
Telling people millions of tests
Were out of condition.

Those tests are not unusable
Just near their experation date.
FDA has to sign off their safety
So we can avoid the waste.

Claim:  Ukraine was responsible for the Kramatorsk train station bombing.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/18/facebook-posts/no-evidence-ukraine-attacked-train-station-one-its/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 There’s no credible evidence that Ukraine was behind the April 8 attack at the Kramatorsk train station. 
A video used to bolster this claim is fake — it did not come from the BBC.
The claim has largely been spread by pro-Kremlin accounts following reports of civilian casualties and contradict earlier Russian posts that initially took credit for the bombing.
The Tochka-U missile used in the attack, and the serial number on it, isn’t proof that it came from the Ukrainian army. 
Several news reports, legitimate photos and videos show that Russia has used these missile systems recently.
 
Poem: 
Russian government decided
To screw with ukranian population,
But to war on the modern world
You need some degree of media manipulation.

A Kramatorsk train station was bombed
There's still no conclusion by who,
But pro-Kremlin internet accounts took the chance
To make their version of the story true.
Legitimate info says otherwise.

Claim:  Actor Steven Seagal spotted among Russian special forces in Ukraine  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/28/joe-rogan/action-star-steven-seagal-friend-putin-not-soldier/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Podcaster Joe Rogan posted a fake CNN story that said action star Steven Seagal was spotted among Russian special forces in Ukraine. 
He later deleted the post, he said, because it was a “parody.”
CNN confirmed that the post purporting to be from its Twitter account was fake.
Seagal does have a friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who granted him citizenship in 2016, 
and Seagal was once banned from Ukraine as a “national security threat.”
 
Poem: 
Turns out Seagal is indeed a russian citizen
Who was banned from Ukraine as a security threat,
But saying Seagal was among russian special forces
Is not a safe bet.

Joe Rogan and CNN
Got into a big mess,
But this time it was easy to confirm the truth
With some quick fact checks.
