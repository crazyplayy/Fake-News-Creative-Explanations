Claim:  Says truck drivers are being turned away from fast-food restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/26/facebook-posts/some-fast-food-chains-turn-away-truckers-drive-thr/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Truck drivers are having issues getting meals at some fast-food chains with shuttered dining rooms. Their rigs can’t fit in drive-thru lanes and they aren’t allowed to walk up and order at the window.
McDonald’s responded to complaints and created a curbside trucker ordering service at some of its locations.
Other fast-food chains haven’t yet implemented a solution.
 
Poem: 

Truck drivers can't go and order some fries
but it's not what your're thinking, at all!
It's just that the trucks are too big in size
and the drive-through windows are just too small!

But McDonalds is granting truckers a wish:
They are bulding taller windows
for the truckers to enjoy their filet-o-fish.
A solution is coming, as it shows.

About vaccines not being good
But no, they actually were disagreeing
With where Trump once stood.

Claim:  It makes no sense to require vaccinations for the previously infected.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/27/facebook-posts/heres-why-experts-say-people-who-had-covid-19-shou/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 People who have had COVID-19 do have some level of immunity; however, the CDC recommends vaccination because it provides better protection.
Naturally acquired immunity may not be as effective against variant strains of the virus that cause COVID-19.
 
Poem: 


"if you had it, you don't need the vaccine",
people say. But the CDC, still protective,
states natural immunity is not that effective
against other strains that cause COVID-19

Claim:  In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/04/chris-larson/yes-gop-did-oppose-40-million-lead-pipe-replacemen/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Gov. Tony Evers proposed $40 million in bonding that his administration estimated would be enough to replace 9 percent of the state's 170,000 lead service lines still in use.
One GOP legislative leader said replacing lead service lines would be too expensive and called for other options, including using drinking water filters in homes.
Another GOP lawmaker called for locally funded efforts because “a vast majority” of the funding would go to Milwaukee.
But the Republican lawmakers also cited other reasons for opposing the program.

Claim:  COVID-19 vaccines caused a 40% increase in deaths identified a life insurance company.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/11/blog-posting/no-covid-19-vaccines-arent-responsible-increase-de/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 OneAmerica CEO Scott Davison said life insurance industry data indicates death rates among working-age people were up 40% compared to pre-pandemic rates.
Social media users have suggested COVID-19 vaccines, rather than the illness itself, are responsible for the increase in deaths.
Research indicates that COVID-19 is likely responsible for the increase; there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines are to blame.
