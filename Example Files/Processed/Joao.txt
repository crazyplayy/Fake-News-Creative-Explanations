Claim:  The United States had 589 coal-fired plants 10 years ago, and we re down to 504. … We are the only nation that has reduced our reliance (on) coal energy.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/10/joe-manchin/how-far-has-us-cut-its-reliance-coal-compared-othe/ 
 
Summary: 
  Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade, although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures.
 He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets. However, other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period.
 
Poem: 
Though it's certain the downfall of coal,
Manchin's numbers are way out of touch.
The point made reached his goal,
but the measurement units coherence, not as much. 

As it wouldn't be enough,
this gentleman's veracity was undermined,
by saying the United States
are alone in the race to close the mines

Claim:  Says spending by Democrats is driving major jumps in car rentals, gas prices and hotel prices this summer  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/06/tom-tiffany/tiffany-misses-point-behind-why-prices-are-rising-/ 
 
Summary: 
 Inflation has gone up since the start of the coronavirus pandemic -- about 5% between May 2020 and May 2021
But the jump in inflation doesn’t account for the rapidly increasing prices for travel
In fact, everyday consumers are driving prices higher as more and more people book trips
 
Poem: 
Blaming the Democrats for inflation is a low blow
when inflation started alongside the pandemic, about two years ago
Maybe Tiffany doesn´t know what supply and demand means
because the more people travel, the bigger the price it seems

Claim:  President Trump has come into contact with a potential coronavirus sufferer!  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/10/facebook-posts/headline-ignores-evidence-overstating-trumps-expos/ 
 
Summary: 
 There is no evidence President Donald Trump came into direct contact with a coronavirus sufferer.
Trump shook hands at a conference with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union and Conservative Political Action Conference.
Schlapp days earlier had had contact with a man who has been confirmed to have the coronavirus.
Schlapp reportedly has no symptoms.
 
Poem: 
Can't men shake each other's hands in peace,
before anyone starts panicking about covid?
Schlapp sure is healthy and the contact was safe.
Is this the worst thing Trump ever did?

Claim:  Carlos Gimenez wants a national database to track you and discriminate against you.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/19/america-first-political-committee/attack-calls-gop-house-member-socialist-wrong-bill/ 
 
Summary: 
 The bill would give federal money to state and local governments to improve data sharing they already do. It would not create a national vaccination database.

Poem: 
Gimenez just wants to improve the current system,
don't just come here and diss him.
Rest assured, you are already tracked.
So it wouldn't be this databased that got you hacked.

Claim:  There s over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous (coronavirus) relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/23/steve-scalise/has-1-trillion-covid-19-relief-gone-unspent/ 
 
Summary: 
 About $1 trillion remains to be disbursed, but a large share of it has been allocated or is scheduled to be spent.
Most of the unspent money was approved in late December, and it takes time to distribute it.
As the economy recovers, some of the money might not be spent.
 
Poem: 
You know a trillion dollars is a lot of money.
So you wouln't expect it to be used in such a hurry.
So don't worry, there is a plan of distribution,
And maybe saving it for another time would be the greatest contribution.
