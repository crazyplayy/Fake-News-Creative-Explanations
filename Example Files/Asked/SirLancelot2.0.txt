Claim:  As the world rallies around Ukraine, Mike Lee was one of only two senators to oppose sanctions on Putin. Then he flew to the Kremlin and discussed dropping sanctions. Lee even opposed arming Ukrainians fighting for their lives.

Summary Explanation: 
 The ad mixes present events, referring to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, with actions Lee took years ago.
Lee voted in 2017 against sanctions against Russia.
The ad is misleading in saying Lee’s votes over several years against large spending bills were evidence that he specifically opposed spending provisions in them to aid Ukraine.

Claim:  A West Virginia inspection sticker on an Uber proves the car was not in Ukraine.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/17/facebook-posts/news-video-shot-car-was-filmed-ukraine-not-west-vi/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A West Virginia State Police captain confirmed that the Uber’s window decal was an expired inspection sticker from the state. But that doesn’t mean that the car itself wasn’t in Ukraine.
The video showing the car was recorded in Irpin, Ukraine, according to Reuters, which owns the video.
It's not uncommon for cars to be exported from the U.S. to other countries, including Ukraine.

Claim: Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president.
 
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/22/marjorie-taylor-greene/marjorie-taylor-greene-falsely-claims-ukraine-was-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report receiving any donations from the Ukrainian government or Ukrainian nationals. Those donations would have been illegal.
A spokesperson for Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a 2015 Wall Street Journal graphic that has been frequently misrepresented online. The chart shows donations to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014 by the nationality of the individuals who made them; it does not say anything about donations to the foundation by foreign governments. 
The Clinton Foundation said it has never received donations from Ukraine’s government.

Claim:  Ukraine issued a press release about Joe Biden  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/07/facebook-posts/press-conference-was-held-2020-orchestrated-russia/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  The press conference was held in May 2020 and featured a Ukrainian lawmaker, Andrii Derkach, who is described by U.S. officials as an active Russian agent. 
 Recordings of President Joe Biden that Derkach released corroborate Biden’s description of his dealings in Ukraine.
