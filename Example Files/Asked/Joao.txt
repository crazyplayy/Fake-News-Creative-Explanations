Summary: 
  Manchin is broadly right to note that the U.S. has decreased its reliance on coal for generating electricity over the past decade, although he incorrectly labeled the units of measurement that went along with his figures.
 He also has a point that the U.S. has led the world in the number of retirements of coal-fired assets. However, other countries have also made significant cuts in coal-fired power over the same period.

Claim:  There s over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous (coronavirus) relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/23/steve-scalise/has-1-trillion-covid-19-relief-gone-unspent/ 
 
Summary: 
 About $1 trillion remains to be disbursed, but a large share of it has been allocated or is scheduled to be spent.
Most of the unspent money was approved in late December, and it takes time to distribute it.
As the economy recovers, some of the money might not be spent.
