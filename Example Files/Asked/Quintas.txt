Claim:  Italy drastically reduced the country’s official COV1D-19 death count over 97%. This means Covid killed fewer people than an average seasonal flu.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/10/facebook-posts/italy-didnt-lower-its-covid-19-death-toll-over-97-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Italy didn’t lower its COVID-19 death count by over 97%. The country’s official death toll exceeds 132,000 people.
The claim misconstrues a recent report by the Italian National Institute of Health that highlighted the most common diseases people already had when they died after contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. An agency spokesperson called the claim “completely wrong.”
Pre-existing conditions are a known risk factor for COVID-19, and the agency said its analysis shows that the disease is the direct cause of death in 89% of people who test positive for the virus.

Claim:  Fauci admits Covid vax doesn t work  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/23/alex-jones/no-fauci-did-not-admit-covid-19-vaccines-arent-wor/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 As evidence, the video cited comments that were cherry-picked from statements Fauci made on The Daily podcast about the necessity of booster shots.
Fauci did not say COVID-19 vaccines are not working.
Waning immunity results from the natural decrease of protective antibodies over time after vaccination. Booster shots are a standard approach to bolster more durable protection by activating longer-lasting immune cells.

Claim:  FACT: Less than 1% of the trash in the ocean is from the United States.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jan/15/young-americas-foundation/does-just-1-ocean-waste-come-united-states/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 This number stems from a peer-reviewed scientific article, but the post’s wording glosses over some nuances.
The 1% figure refers to "mismanaged" waste entering the ocean in 2010, and does not take into account the accumulated waste already in the ocean prior to that year.
The study also looked only at the country that immediately held the waste before it entered the ocean. It’s possible that the United States generated an additional volume of plastic waste that ended up in another country before going into the ocean.

Claim:  The Paris Climate Agreement is bad for America, because it does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/26/rick-scott/paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-and-india-us/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Paris Climate Agreement relies on public reporting, not firm penalties, to keep countries on track.
Its accountability rules are the same for all nations.
China emits more carbon dioxide than the U.S., but per person, the U.S. emits more than China.

Claim:  In Joe Biden’s America, your children are more likely to have access to a crack pipe than a mask-free education.  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/10/troy-nehls/claim-kids-more-likely-have-access-crack-pipes-mas/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The claim alludes to a Biden administration anti-drug abuse program. Grant money from the program can be used for a variety of efforts, including providing safe-smoking kits, which are intended to reduce disease among illegal drug users that is caused by the sharing of smoking materials. We found no evidence the kits are aimed at children.
Federal officials said the funds cannot be used to provide pipes.
There is no federal mandate requiring children to wear masks in schools. Within the next several weeks, fewer than a dozen states will have such mandates as part of their efforts to fight COVID-19.

Claim:  Says imposters in hazmat suits are going door to door in Stockton, Calif., saying they are checking residents for fever or COVID-19, but they will enter your home and physically attempt robbery.  
Label: false

Summary Explanation: 
 Posts around the nation warn people not to open their doors to imposters who say they are doing coronavirus testing but actually want to rob the residents.
Like other such claims, this one about an alleged scam in Stockton, Calif., is false, according to police.

Claim:  In some of these other states, some of their deaths can be attributable to the fact that they were having a hard time getting an ICU bed or a ventilator to a patient.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/03/roy-cooper/cooper-overstates-ventilator-access-problem/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said some COVID-19 patients have died because they couldn't access a ventilator or bed in an Intensive Care Unit.
Studies have shown that mortality rates rise when hospitals are overwhelmed, and some news articles suggest that has happened during the pandemic.
However, the American Hospital Association and other experts say they're not aware of specific cases where the lack of a ventilator or ICU bed directly contributed to someone's death.

Claim:  Says Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak has banned the use of an anti-malaria drug that might help cure coronavirus.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/27/turning-point-usa/conservative-group-meme-distorts-nevadas-chloroqui/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A Nevada emergency regulation restricts the prescription of chloroquine for COVID-19 patients in outpatient settings, but not in hospitals and emergency rooms.
Gov. Steve Sisolak signed the order on the recommendation of state health officials, who said there is the potential for stockpiling the drug.
Federal regulators say the effectiveness of chloroquine in treating COVID-19 is anecdotal, and more research and clinical trials are needed.

Claim:  In New York state, if you’re white, you have to go to the back of the line to get medical help.  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/27/donald-trump/no-new-york-has-not-delayed-covid-19-treatment-whi/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 People who are immunocompromised are to be prioritized for COVID-19 treatments under state guidelines, regardless of race.
CDC data shows that people who are Black and Hispanic are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 as their white peers.
The state is advising health care providers to consider race and ethnicity as a risk factor, among many other risk factors, in distributing treatments for the virus.
There is no evidence that treatment for white people has been delayed or denied.
