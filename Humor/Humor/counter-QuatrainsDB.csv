Neubauer then went up in a bucket lift and used an 8-foot (2-meter) fiberglass stick to try to nudge the bear to go down. He even tried talking to it.” ","“Oh bear, permit me please to nudge:
(I would not wish to knock):
For you’ll receive, unless you budge,
A sharp electric shock!”

Though thus the lineman urged, and waved
A stick, of length two meters,
The bear, refusing to be saved,
Replied to all entreaters:

“O humans, cease to trouble me;
I would not be facetious,
But this is quite (a tendency
With all your species) specious.

“Aloft, alone, I’ve settled on
My stationary position
In honor of St. Simeon,
Who fired my life’s ambition;

“And though you may assume a guest
For me’s a social highlight,
Please understand that least is best
For any ursine stylite.

“So please remove yourself—I’ll say
No more, for I’m refined;
Just note, it’s best to go away
Without a bear behind.”

And all for the prize in the Iditarod?

The sled was heaped high with tarpaulins and starch,
The dogs were in harness and sturdily shod,
Intent on success in the Iditarod.
 
They sledded through Willow, their spirits were high,
The tundra and spruces were sweet to the eye;
Brave Nick offered praise to the dogs as they trod:
O how could they fail in the Iditarod!
 
Now Rohn was behind them and also McGrath,
When Nick felt inside him the stirrings of wrath:
Two huskies were snarling. “This isn’t so odd,”
Thought he, “with the strains of the Iditarod”;
 
But three blizzards on, by the cold Bering Sea,
He turned on the two with a curseword or three.
Then snorted the pack: “Does he think he is God?
Let him take the pull for the Iditarod!”
 
And down on their haunches they parked in the snow.
Not one further step could he coax them to go;
So home again sadly Nick knew he must plod,
So close to his goal in the Iditarod.

Defeated by dogs in a difficult clime;
Let’s hope they’ll forgive him and give him the nod
To come back next year for the Iditarod.

But think of what happens when someone’s too good.
Some predator hates him and creeps from some wood
And stalks him and gets him sometime in the night.
Poor creatures like Kevin are not born to fight.
 
They’re born to show off and with feathers galore
Teach love-stricken gawkers what Beauty is for.
Delighting in excess and high on display,
Their every small gesture will brighten one’s day,
 
And that’s why they’re hated by those who hate joy;
Whose motives are malice; who live to destroy;
Who cannot stand actors who help others cope
And drive away sorrow by giving folks hope!
 
So, Kevin, please know as you strut in the sky,
We love you and miss you. This isn’t Goodbye.
You’ll live in our hearts. You will not disappear.
Tail-up and triumphant, you’ll always be here!

The surfboard, and the chandelier,
In time with conch and conch:

For Mary Lou had won her Race,
Her very best encore;
While one might trace in Race’s face
The conscious conqueror.

Who bumbled into crime,
Once famed for serving aces,
Is now just serving time.

Was hit with too much spin,
And hence his new location,
No longer OUT! but IN!

The moral of this folly?
When candor falls so short,
One can expect a volley,
In quite a different court.

A polydactyl rescue cat, Paddles once famously interrupted a phone conversation between the PM and Donald Trump by “flying through the cat-flap” and “announcing her very squawky arrival,” and she had a popular Twitter account. In the aftermath of Paddles’ death, businessman Gareth Morgan sparked outrage by criticising the PM for allowing her cat to wander freely, questioning Ardern’s “conservation integrity.”","New Zealand’s in mourning, and raw lamentation
Resounds through the hills and in every bay,
For Paddles, preeminent pet of our nation,
So young and so perfect, was taken away.

She once was a stray on the streets of Ranui,
An outcast defined by opposable thumbs.
Alas for poor Paddles! Our eyes are all dewy.
Our grief is a torment that harrows and numbs.

She rose to distinction despite her beginning
(Social justice for all is what Labour’s about).
Alas for poor Paddles! Our heads are still spinning.
We’ll not love again for our hearts are in drought.

Paddles would sometimes behave as she oughtn’t—
She once interrupted a president’s call.
Alas for poor Paddles! She, too, was important,
And spoke better sense with her loud caterwaul.

A cantankerous businessman quickly went bleating
That it’s good for the birdlife that Paddles is dead.
Alas for poor Paddles! She really liked tweeting.
Alas it was not Gareth Morgan instead!

Remember, remember the Seventh November!
How desolate, dismal, and doleful a day!
Alas that poor Paddles, First Family member,
So young and so perfect, was taken away!

He’s been exonerated. That’s our boy!
However long it takes Paris or Rome
or New York City, poets can come home.

No longer must they rot on foreign turf,

Once more they’re citizens where they belong,
and can indulge in city life and song.

Once more they’re welcome home, although they’re dead.
So what? This time they will not face the dread
of banishment. They could write what they please—
if it were not too late, by centuries!

True poets everywhere, have heart and hope.
Though trials are many, you must learn to cope.
Wherever you’ve been exiled, just stay true.
At last your country may come home to you.
