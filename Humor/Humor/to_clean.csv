An unforeseen experience,
Much more impressive than it sounds:

Lunged out, and grabbed one cherished pup,

A fact which should both cheer and scare:

"“A French company has been found liable for the death of an employee who had a cardiac arrest while having sex with a stranger on a business trip. … The man, named as Xavier X, was working as an engineer for TSO, a railway services company based near Paris.
He died at a hotel during a trip to central France in 2013, as a result of what the employer called ‘an extramarital relationship with a perfect stranger’.
The company challenged a decision by the state health insurance provider to regard the death as a workplace accident.
The provider defended its position by insisting that sexual activity was normal, ‘like taking a shower or a meal’.
In its ruling, the Paris appeals court upheld this view.""
";"An engineer named Xavier (known widely as XX)
Was finished by a heart-attack, confounding top execs;
He died upon a business trip, while busy (one might say);
And so his health insurers thought his company should pay.
 
The company objected (with regrets about his heart)
That in that piece of business his employers had no part;
“’Twas normal!” the insurers urged, “so compensation’s due;”
And France’s top judiciary upheld this point of view:
 
It was a workplace accident that claimed your employee:
He accidentally succumbed to life’s normality,
And workplace liability applies to normal dangers,
Like taking showers and eating meals and having sex with strangers.

";"How long had she been waiting, far from home,
Proud posture and immortal silver stare,
When an enthusiast trepanned the loam
In a dim Oxford field, and struck her there?
He brushed her gently: from her leaden dress
Dropped years of earth. How many, though? How long?
Resisting hope, he made a prudent guess
And called her Modern Copy. He was wrong.
He put her in a plastic tub, once packed
With Flora margarine; her moment past,
She lay forgotten, verdigrised and cracked,
For ten more years, till somebody at last
Glanced in and found her—this unlooked-for prize:
Flora-Minerva, of the silver eyes.

About two-thirds what EXXON Mobil spent
On lobbying the nation’s government;
Sixteen percent (or not that much below)
The yearly pay of FOX’s CEO.

Most earn (in dollars) just 4K per year,
And he who found them surely made no more;
But this is what he’ll use his money for:
Provisions for his neighbors, and a school.
“Not educated”? Sure, but ah! no fool.

"“A newly published letter, written by TS Eliot in 1960, has shed fresh light on the writer’s relationship with a woman he corresponded with for 26 years. …
Eliot wrote hundreds of letters to Hale while he was married to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood.
The letters were unsealed this week at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Their unsealing prompted the publication of Eliot’s letter, which he had said should only be released when his letters to Hale were made public.""
";"It has come to my ears that Miss Emily Hale
Is glossing my letters. Bad taste on this scale
Compels me to issue a record, although
I shudder to put what is private on show.
In Harvard at Graduate School, I declared
The love that Miss Hale has now vulgarly aired;
From Oxford in 1914, I addressed
Some letters where friendship alone was expressed.
The years wed to Vivienne Haigh-Wood I found
Sheer agony, but for the praises of Pound;
And yet, though the nightmare we jointly endured
Drove me to “The Waste Land,” and her to a ward,
She did let the poet inside me prevail,
And saved me from marrying Emily Hale.
I saw, with poor Vivienne sadly deceased,
I was not in love with Miss Hale in the least:
That what I had taken for love was, in truth,
A memory only of love in my youth;
And it was impossible not to divine
Her deafness to verse, in particular mine.
Though maybe she loved, my opinions meant less
To her than her uncle’s, whose mind was a mess;
Although Unitarian, still she’d prefer
The Anglican rites, quite improper for her;
And lastly (insensitive, surely, and coarse)
She did not respect my beliefs on divorce.
When Vivienne died, I observed that, at most,
My love was the love of a ghost for a ghost;
I hereby record this, before my decease.
We never had sex. May we all rest in peace.

And sixteen brave huskies, a regular squad:

The sled was heaped high with tarpaulins and starch,
The dogs were in harness and sturdily shod,
Intent on success in the Iditarod.
 
They sledded through Willow, their spirits were high,
The tundra and spruces were sweet to the eye;
Brave Nick offered praise to the dogs as they trod:
O how could they fail in the Iditarod!
 
Now Rohn was behind them and also McGrath,
When Nick felt inside him the stirrings of wrath:
Two huskies were snarling. “This isn’t so odd,”
Thought he, “with the strains of the Iditarod”;
 
But three blizzards on, by the cold Bering Sea,
He turned on the two with a curseword or three.
Then snorted the pack: “Does he think he is God?
Let him take the pull for the Iditarod!”
 
And down on their haunches they parked in the snow.
Not one further step could he coax them to go;
So home again sadly Nick knew he must plod,
So close to his goal in the Iditarod.
 
And this is the story of Nick-out-of-time,
Defeated by dogs in a difficult clime;
Let’s hope they’ll forgive him and give him the nod
To come back next year for the Iditarod.

auburn hair, blue eyes who stood at 3ft 1in tall and weighed 16lbs. He was said to be wearing
blue denim overalls with a multi-colored striped long sleeve shirt and carrying a large knife—
matching his appearance in the films. His race was listed as ‘Other: Doll.’ …
The department issued a statement saying: ‘This alert is a result of a test malfunction.
We apologize for the confusion this may have caused and are diligently working
to ensure this does not happen again.’""

No one’s going to be hurt;
That was just a non-satanic
False emergency alert.

The Owl looked up at the stars above

And sighed “Oh Rufus, oh Rufus my love,
 That mouse was rather too rich,
 Too rich,
Too rich;
 That mouse was rather too rich.”
 
Rufus said to the Owl: “You inelegant fowl,
 You’ve binged till you’re quite obese!
Come, look to your diet: it’s vain to deny it;
 This gorging henceforth must cease.”
So he kept her away from her rodent buffet.
 Who knows how the foodie felt?
But after a week with a monitored beak,
 Her shape was slender and svelte
And svelte
And svelte:
 Her shape was slender and svelte.
 
“Dear Owl, are you willing to limit your killing
 To half?” Said the Owl, “I’ll try—“
And in token of proof, as a gesture to Rufus,
 She shrugged as a bunny went by.
She dined on beans, and spinachy greens,
 Which are rare in an owl’s milieu;
Then hand in hand on the Stonemarket Strand
 She danced with Rufus a deux
À deux,

"“Anti-Gay Hungarian Politician Resigns After Being Caught At Massive Male Orgy [in Brussels] 
In Violation Of COVID-19 Restrictions""
";"You may act one way at home
But you know that when in Rome,
You’re advised to do the things the Romans do;
Well, in Brussels it’s the same—
So you can’t be held to blame
If they threw an orgy and invited you.
 
Back in Hungary your days
Have been spent oppressing gays
With the policies and laws that you produce.
But now everybody knows you’re
Quite indecent an ex-poseur
And your “family values” stance was just a ruse.
 
The hypocrisy looks awful,
But your bawdy Belgian waffle
Isn’t why you just resigned beneath a cloud;
No, what got you apprehended
Is the number that attended,
For your saturnalia drew too large a crowd.
 
In our current Covid crisis
We’re all making sacrifices,
Such that even making whoopee’s making do.
So it wouldn’t really hurt you
If your vice possessed some virtue:
Keep your gangbangs down to just “we happy few.”
 
There’s a cynical contempt
In your thinking you’re exempt,
That your status makes you not like all the rest.
Let the sentence fit the crime
With some solo sex this time:
You can [[screw]] yourself right back to Budapest.

";"You probably could kill the dinosaurs
With just 9 billions’ worth of kilotons.
Our overzealous cosmos never bores:
So many frogs’ eggs, grains of sand, moons, suns—
A plethora of pistils, stamens, spores!
And wayward rocks routine as misplaced guns.

";"You see the green-capped bowler scampering
To field the bright red ball he nearly caught?
One side of it he’s polishing and pampering,
The other, roughing up, as he’s been taught—
With no “Not cricket!” scruples hampering—
A batsman may record a big fat nought
Through swing enhanced by cover-tampering.

To make this charming pirate fall

that you deserve a hug—
please, after this festivity,

Unfettered large-scale farming industry
Tears down the web of rural life I knew,
Upsetting nature’s ways. The heart will be
Ripped out of Britain’s countryside if your

Knee-deep in what makes agriculture pure …
