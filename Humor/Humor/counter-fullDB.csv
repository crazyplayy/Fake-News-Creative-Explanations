And saved me from marrying Emily Hale.
I saw, with poor Vivienne sadly deceased,
I was not in love with Miss Hale in the least:
That what I had taken for love was, in truth,
A memory only of love in my youth;
And it was impossible not to divine
Her deafness to verse, in particular mine.
Though maybe she loved, my opinions meant less
To her than her uncle’s, whose mind was a mess;
Although Unitarian, still she’d prefer
The Anglican rites, quite improper for her;
And lastly (insensitive, surely, and coarse)
She did not respect my beliefs on divorce.
When Vivienne died, I observed that, at most,
My love was the love of a ghost for a ghost;

And sixteen brave huskies, a regular squad:
And all for the prize in the Iditarod?
 
They set out from Anchorage early in March:
The sled was heaped high with tarpaulins and starch,
The dogs were in harness and sturdily shod,
Intent on success in the Iditarod.
 
They sledded through Willow, their spirits were high,
The tundra and spruces were sweet to the eye;
Brave Nick offered praise to the dogs as they trod:
O how could they fail in the Iditarod!
 
Now Rohn was behind them and also McGrath,
When Nick felt inside him the stirrings of wrath:
Two huskies were snarling. “This isn’t so odd,”
Thought he, “with the strains of the Iditarod”;
 
But three blizzards on, by the cold Bering Sea,
He turned on the two with a curseword or three.
Then snorted the pack: “Does he think he is God?
Let him take the pull for the Iditarod!”
 
And down on their haunches they parked in the snow.
Not one further step could he coax them to go;
So home again sadly Nick knew he must plod,
So close to his goal in the Iditarod.
 
And this is the story of Nick-out-of-time,
Defeated by dogs in a difficult clime;
Let’s hope they’ll forgive him and give him the nod
To come back next year for the Iditarod.

A wish to rob their households is a wish that should be curbed;
Recall Nicole from Canada, who yielded to the aura
Of two mosaic tiles, a shard, and parts of an amphora.

She smuggled them from Naples with her other souvenirs,
And in her chilly northern home they waited many years.
Meanwhile, Nicole, though doubtless much revering them at first,
Was slowly made to feel herself inevitably cursed.

No need to list the nasty things the pilferer endured;
They soaked her like the waters of an overflowing fjord,
Till, medically sick of the avenging bric a brac,
She bowed her head in penitence and sent the whole lot back.

In picturesque Pompeii, upon the rich volcanic loam,
Two tiles and bits of pottery embrace their proper home.
The local gods are smiling, but, to coin an apothegm:
Unless your name’s Vesuvius, don’t mess about with them.

1098,"Vladimir Putin “attended an Easter mass conducted by the Russian Orthodox Church… (He) stood to one side… holding a lit red candle,… crossed himself several times during the ceremony… (and) joined the other members of the congregation” in prayer.","Jiggery-pokery,
Putin the slaughterer
holding a candle and
praying? Egad!

Many a monster of
Mephistophelian
infamy can’t hold a
candle to Vlad.

Doubledy-troubledy
Putin the slaughterer,
tyrant who rules at a
terrible cost,

trying his best to seem
unhypocritical,
crossed himself—and, to be
sure, double-crossed.

1099,White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany compared President Trump’s visit to a church to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War II.,"Sure, Trump’s like Winston Churchill:
A Bible in his hand,
he poses at the Church front,
the way such heroes stand.

But wait. There’s something missing.
This wasn’t quite the Blitz,
and Trump relied on tear gas.
And Churchill had his wits.
