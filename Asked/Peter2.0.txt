Claim:  Gas is high because they shut down production in the U.S. under the Biden administration.  
Label: false

Summary Explanation: 
 Gas prices soared to an average $4.173 per gallon on March 8, according to AAA, breaking a 2008 record.
Oil production in the U.S. in President Joe Biden’s first year was on par with 2020 and higher than in two of the four years Trump was president.
Increased consumer demand, inflation and the war in Ukraine are among the factors in the rising price at the pump, experts say.

Claim:  A video taken from a car driving through Bucha, Ukraine, shows a corpse moving his arm, and then in the rear view mirror the ‘corpse’ sits down.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/04/russian-ministry-defense/russia-pushes-false-crisis-actor-claims-about-vide/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Russian Ministry of Defense and other top Russian officials claimed that a video of a car driving through Ukraine showed two crisis actors playing the role of dead Ukrainians in a staged massacre. On Telegram and Twitter, they claimed that the video showed one person moving their arm, and another person seen in the car’s mirror sitting up.
The video does not show a person raising an arm as the car drives by; it shows a mark floating across the car’s windshield — perhaps a drop of water or a speck of dirt.
The video does not show someone sitting up after the car drives by; it shows a stationary corpse through the lens of the car’s passenger-side mirror, which has distorting effects.

Claim:  Two years ago we were drilling our own oil for $27 a barrel. Now, thanks to Joe Biden, we’re paying $105 a barrel to Russia.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/10/facebook-posts/social-media-post-drilling-and-cost-russian-oil-mi/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The U.S. was selling its oil for about $27 per barrel — not  drilling for that price, energy experts said. And, due to the pandemic, it was losing money in the process.
Energy analysts said that the notion that the U.S. has been paying $105 per barrel for Russian oil probably isn’t too far off, though it’s hard to pinpoint. In general, prices were going up throughout January and February, so the U.S. was paying more for all oil imports, not just those from Russia.
The current, higher prices are largely attributable to Russia’s war in Ukraine and to a sluggish response to energy demands after the pandemic slowdown.
