Claim:  Says Gov. Tony Evers removed the American flag from the Capitol building  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/29/facebook-posts/claim-tony-evers-ordered-us-flag-removed-ridiculou/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The picture presented as proof was from a rally in support of reopening Wisconsin on April 24, 2020.
Like most protests, that occurred on the West side of the building, where the flagpole atop the entrance is controlled by the state Assembly.
The Assembly only flies the U.S. flag there when in session, and they weren’t that day.
The additional detail about Evers ordering a flag to be removed is nonsense.

Claim:  In my state, as in many other states, we have governors who are closing down businesses again.  
Label: true

Summary Explanation: 
 Earlier this month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf halted indoor dining, closed casinos, gyms, and entertainment venues, and lowered retail occupancy limits statewide for the first time since the spring. The new restrictions came as the state started reporting more than 10,000 new infections per day.
Before this latest round of closures, all 67 Pennsylvania counties had been in the “green” phase of the Wolf administration’s three-step reopening plan since July 3, even though Trump falsely claimed otherwise on the campaign trail.
Across the country, at least seven other states and the District of Columbia have joined Pennsylvania and imposed restrictions on large numbers of businesses. They include Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, and New Mexico.

Claim:  Coronavirus vaccinations seem to be causing 50 times the adverse events of flu vaccinations after just the first of two shots.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/15/facebook-posts/claim-comparing-adverse-events-covid-19-flu-vaccin/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Raw data indicate that the rate of reported “adverse events” — ranging from mild side effects to serious health problems or death — following COVID-19 vaccinations is many times higher than for flu shots.
Reports of adverse events to the federal tracking system are not verified, and the CDC and experts say the data cannot be used to draw conclusions about vaccinations causing the adverse events.
Experts say the data about the new COVID-19 vaccinations are too new to make meaningful comparisons with flu shots.

Claim:  The Green New Deal would require that 99% of homes in the country be torn down and rebuilt more ‘energy efficient’ over a ten year period.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/01/instagram-posts/green-new-deal-would-not-require-99-homes-be-torn-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  The Green New Deal is a nonbinding resolution that cannot become law in its current form. 
 The resolution does not call for most homes to be torn down. It aims to upgrade existing buildings and build new buildings to improve energy and water efficiency.
 Much of the confusion and misinformation about the resolution stemmed from a botched rollout by its sponsors and relentless attacks from opponents.

Claim:  With the goal to preserve 30% of the earth’s land and water 2030, 300 million people stand to lose their land and livelihood, most of them tribal and indigenous peoples.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/07/survival-international/would-protecting-30-worlds-land-and-waters-hurt-30/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Over 50 nations want to put 30% of the world’s land and waters into protected status by 2030.
Advocacy groups for indigenous people say the move would force 300 million people off their land.
Supporters of the plan say giving indigenous people more power is the key to land and water protections.
