Summary Explanation: 
 Jay Chaudhuri and Natasha Marcus, North Carolina state Senators, want to make it easier for people to vote absentee by mail.
In an op-ed, they claim that NC is in the "small minority" of states that require two witnesses to sign an absentee ballot.
That's true. NC is one of only three states that require the ballots to be signed by two witnesses if a notary isn't available.

Claim:  Gates Foundation stands to make nearly £31.5 billion on a coronavirus vaccine in U.K.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/14/facebook-posts/no-evidence-gates-foundation-will-profit-coronavir/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The £31.5 billion figure was calculated by multiplying an estimated cost per vaccine times the population of the United Kingdom. The estimated vaccine cost comes from a Daily Mail story, but we could find no other evidence to back it up.
The Gates Foundation has pledged millions of dollars to companies developing potential coronavirus vaccines. There is no evidence that the charity stands to profit from them.
The source of the Facebook post is a website that has published false conspiracy theories in the past.

Claim:  Says researchers found a fabric that kills coronaviruses  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/30/facebook-posts/research-fabric-can-neutralize-coronavirus-masks/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 “Electroceutical fabric” was developed in 2017 as an antimicrobial wound dressing, but a new study shows it is also effective at neutralizing coronaviruses.
The makers are seeking FDA emergency approval to use it for COVID-19 face masks.
Metal embedded in the fabric creates an electric current that stops the virus from assembling and attaching to the host after a minute of exposure to the electrical field.
These findings are in a preliminary study that has not yet gone through the peer-review process.
