 Those golf and rally dates are correct
The CDC’s Jan. 8 coronavirus “warning” says the threat to Americans was low and didn’t establish person-to-person transmission
Trump took action against the spread of COVID-19 before March 13

Claim:  Canada has just criminalized all CV19 measures requiring masks, distancing, quarantining & vaccines.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/11/facebook-posts/no-canada-did-not-criminalize-covid-19-restriction/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  The Canadian government has not enacted a law that criminalizes COVID-19 restrictions or prevents enforcement of those guidelines.
 There are places in Canada where you can be fined for disobeying COVID-19 public health orders. 
 The post appears to be referring to a proclamation issued by a “council of citizens’ assemblies.”

Claim:  Says President Donald Trump is trying to make $451 billion in Medicare cuts in the middle of a deadly pandemic.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/29/priorities-usa-action/democratic-super-pac-uses-familiar-political-play-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The timeline of events doesn’t support this statement.
The $451 billion figure is accurate, but presented in a misleading way. It is not a direct program cut to beneficiaries. Instead, it is the result of lowering payments to providers. It also reflects a 10-year budget window.

Claim:  Study: hydroxychloroquine can boost COVID-19 survival chances nearly 200%.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/14/facebook-posts/post-overstates-studys-200-finding-hydroxychloroqu/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A study says a certain dosing of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin “improves survival by nearly 200%” among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation.
The study is posted on a website that publishes “preprints” — studies that “have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.”
Experts called the study poorly designed and caution against drawing conclusions about cause and effect.
