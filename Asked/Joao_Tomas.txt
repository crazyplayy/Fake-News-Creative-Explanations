Claim:  Of the Trump administration’s European travel restrictions that exempt the U.K.: Well, you can just get into the Chunnel, and you’ll be in the U.K.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/12/nancy-pelosi/can-europeans-get-around-trump-travel-ban-going-en/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 It isn’t that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France.
The travel ban applies to people who were in designated European countries 14 days before their attempted travel to the United States.
Someone in France who traveled to England would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions.

Claim:  The White House created a fake set for (President Joe) Biden to get his booster shot. The entire Biden presidency is one giant charade.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/sep/30/facebook-posts/no-joe-biden-didnt-get-his-booster-shot-fake-white/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  Biden received his booster shot in the South Court Auditorium of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, a frequent venue for White House news events and photo ops.
