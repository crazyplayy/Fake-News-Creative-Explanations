Summary Explanation: 
 Sam Hyde is a comedian whose name has been used as an online meme since 2015, linked to tragic events throughout the world.
There is no evidence that the mysterious “Ghost of Kyiv” pilot in Ukraine actually exists.
If the pilot does exist, it’s not Samuyil Hyde.
 
Poem: 
Ghost of Kyiv is not Sam Hyde,
funny or not he’s not the fighter-ace.
Memes about tragic events are worldwide,
his true existence has no trace.

Claim:  Biden won’t allow Delta-variant COVID patients to get proven and effective monoclonal treatments even though there are 50,000-100,000 Americans infected Delta EVERY DAY.  
Label: barely-true

Summary Explanation: 
 The FDA recently revoked its emergency use authorization on two monoclonal antibody treatments. Eventually delta-positive COVID-19 patients will likely be unable to get them.
The drugs were found to be ineffective against the omicron variant, which makes up nearly 100% of cases in the U.S.
The FDA still allows four other drugs that remain effective for both variants, including another monoclonal antibody treatment called sotromivab.
Gabbard’s estimate of daily delta patients appears to be way off, with national surveillance data putting the average closer to 1,000 a day.
 
Poem: 
Drugs ineffective on one variant,
don’t mean it’s on all.
Don’t be barbarian,
there’s enough to cause downfall.

Claim:  Ron DeSantis let millions of COVID-19 tests expire.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/04/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-overstates-claim-about-millions-expi/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Crist overstated the number of expired tests, it was up to 1 million, not “millions.”
Crist’s statement leaves the impression that the tests were no longer usable. However, because the tests were stored safely, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has allowed the tests to be used by March 2022.
DeSantis attributed their expiration to lack of demand and to pending approvals from the federal government. Before Florida could distribute the tests, the FDA had to sign off on their safety.
 
Poem: 
Million is not millions.
if stored safe is usable,
No need to freak, civilians!
The FDA had to narrow the inexcusable.
