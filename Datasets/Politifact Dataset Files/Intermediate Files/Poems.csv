Whale populations are not close to recovering fully. Experts said their numbers will never return to what they once were before whale hunting was regulated. Today, they face both climate change and other manmade threats.
Experts and scientific data show that koalas are vulnerable due to elevated carbon dioxide levels, predatory animals, bush fires and more.

 Absorbing excess carbon dioxide is harmful to oceans and sea life because it increases acid levels in the water.
