Omicron accounts for over 99% of new cases, and this class of drugs only works when given soon after diagnosis. While these drugs helped earlier in the pandemic, they are no longer lifesaving. The agency still allows four other drugs to be used against COVID-19, including another monoclonal antibody treatment called sotromivab, that do work against omicron.","The now-limited monoclonal antibody treatments are not lifesaving, nor are they effective against omicron. Eli Lilly’s treatment became nearly 3,000 times less effective against the variant, and REGEN-COV was more than 1,000 times less effective.

For one, just 37 states and Washington D.C. have been recording data on recoveries. Also, different standards are in place for determining whether a patient has recovered. In Texas, the statewide figure for recoveries is an estimate based on hospitalization data. Plus, a better metric for comparison is the recovery rate of the virus, given Texas’ population size. Using this measure, Texas ranks 16th among those states with data.

Travel restrictions implemented Trump perhaps helped hold down transmission in the context of broader efforts, but on their own, they don’t seem to have significantly reduced the transmission rate of the coronavirus.","President Donald Trump keeps saying his efforts to lock down the country and implement restrictions for those traveling from China saved 2 million lives.

But the governor left out some critical facts that would give a different impression about how New York compares with other states for how nursing home residents are faring. New York counts deaths that occur in a nursing home, leaving out those deaths of residents in hospitals.

Andrew Cuomo forced nursing homes across the state to admit COVID-positive patients and that this policy fueled the spread of COVID-19 that led to thousands of deaths in the nursing home population. Although nursing homes felt pressure to accept COVID-positive patients, they were not actually forced to do so. State regulations require nursing homes to accept patients only if they can care for them, and they could have refused them on those grounds. In addition, it’s unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths. Infection control is a longstanding problem in nursing homes that predates the pandemic and a report showed peak numbers of nursing home deaths came prior to the peak influx of patients as a result of Cuomo’s advisory. While the introduction of COVID-19 positive patients into nursing homes no doubt had an effect on infection spread, Caputo’s statement suggests it was solely responsible.","New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been dogged by criticism for months over his March advisory directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19.

The state health department issued a report in July that concluded the deadly coronavirus was introduced by nursing home staffers rather than sick patients.
Though some epidemiologists and nursing home advocates questioned the report’s methods and findings, public health experts agreed with the report’s conclusion — based on the timeline — that nursing home staffers and visitors, before they were banned, were likely the main drivers of COVID-19 infection and death in nursing homes.

Rather, it’s because the agency is concerned that, with flu season approaching, patients with respiratory illness symptoms should be screened for both the flu and COVID. The patients shouldn’t be tested for COVID alone, because flu cases might be missed.

According to experts, the CDC chose to withdraw its EUA request because it wanted to direct laboratories and testing facilities to use a protocol that tests for multiple viruses at once, not just the COVID virus, to save time and resources as flu season approaches.

Last year, the state’s job growth rate was more than a percentage point higher than the country’s. But a clarification is needed: California is far from the only state that’s added jobs at a faster pace than the national average. Fourteen others accomplished the same feat.

Yet, five other states had higher job growth rates in 2014. Those states are part of ""the rest of the nation,"" and would likely balk at the idea of California outpacing their job growth success.

First, Trump doesn’t solely get the credit, or the blame, for anything in the CARES Act; it was supported virtually all congressional Democrats as well. The financial firms criticized for benefiting from the Great Recession bailouts do receive some ancillary benefits from the act, but the loan-accepting companies are the primary target of such largesse, not the banks. About three-quarters of the loans in the Paycheck Protection Program were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people. UPDATE: After publication, we received the following response from the Lincoln Project. While Wall Street is used to describe the capital markets and the financial industry, Main Street is typically used to describe the larger economy in which the vast majority of people live and work. Charlie Gasparino, the senior correspondent at Fox Business Network, wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post, These measures will almost certainly benefit Wall Street and market speculation — even as their impact on Main Street will be slow to come. He also wrote, Wall Street traders will make money, while Main Street businesses face economic conditions not seen since the Great Depression. Private equity, one of the largest sectors of the financial industry, is looking to cash in on COVID-19 relief money. According to an article from Vanity Fair, Among those angling for a federal handout is one of the wealthiest sectors of the American economy: private equity. These firms not only have a record $1.5 trillion in cash on the sidelines, waiting to be invested, but their CEOs are among America’s richest executives. So why should they be permitted to raid the federal Treasury in a time of crisis?"," It’s wrong to say that coronavirus relief legislation didn’t support ordinary small businesses. The CARES Act included the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to support smaller employers.
 Among the loans made with the first $350 billion of the Paycheck Protection Program, three-quarters of those loans were made in the smallest loan size category, one that would support a business of roughly seven to 10 people. 
 In addition, singling out Trump for problems with how coronavirus relief efforts ignores that the efforts were also backed by virtually all congressional Democrats.

More severe cases can cause pneumonia, kidney failure and death, according to the World Health Organization. A CDC fact-sheet describing common human coronaviruses said most people contract some type of coronavirus during their lives and that the more common strains ""usually cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory-tract illnesses, like the common cold."" But the same fact sheet also knocked down the idea that the 2019 coronavirus was the exact same as the more common strains. ""This information applies to common human coronaviruses and should not be confused with Coronavirus Disease-2019,"" it said. The majority of viruses that cause the common cold are rhinoviruses, according to the CDC. Cases range from mild to moderate in severity, and many adults get two or three colds per year. Children are more likely to get them. In contrast, cases of the coronavirus have ranged from mild to severe, including illness resulting in death. Older people and those with preexisting medical conditions are more likely to suffer complications from COVID-19, while children are not. The virus has an estimated 3.4% mortality rate. In short, the 2019 coronavirus is a novel strain that was unknown before December 2019. It is different and can be much more dangerous than the common cold. Despite the differences, prevention for both the 2019 coronavirus and the common cold are relatively similar: wash your hands, avoid touching your face and stay away from people who are sick.","The 2019 coronavirus is part of a family of viruses that produce illnesses ranging from the common cold to more critical diseases such as SARS or MERS.
The 2019 coronavirus is a new virus that had not been previously identified.
Most cases of the 2019 coronavirus disease have been mild, but it’s been lethal for some people.

However, Steyer has since left the investment group he started, and asked his company to divest any of his holdings from fossil fuels, including tar sands. He also donated his profits from the Kinder Morgan pipeline to charity. Further, as of 2014, Farallon is no longer invested in Keystone’s competitor, according to SEC filings.

But while she cited this big number from the CRS report at Poinciana, she also glossed over a number of caveats that raise questions about the significance of the No. 1 ranking. The U.S. lead is predominantly due to its large stores of coal, yet coal’s environmental effects pose a question mark for the future use of these resources. Meanwhile, for both coal and other fossil fuels, there’s continuing uncertainty about whether the U.S. will be able to exploit these resources in a way that’s economically feasible. Finally, there’s no way of knowing which renewable or experimental energy sources will become important in the future, and as a result, whether the U.S. will be well placed to dominate the field.

Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight. Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments. Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval. And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight. Here's what Dorworth said: ""This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do.

While Romney appears to have favored cap and trade in the past, his actions as governor better prove his skepticism of the policy than his support for it. When he could have signed it into law, he declined. And more recently, Romney has repeatedly said he’s opposed to it. UPDATE, Feb. 22, 2012 After we published this story, a reader pointed us to an air pollution plan Romney proposed that was specific to Massachusetts power plants. It was separate from the regional compact that we noted in the original item. The state proposal set emissions limits on power plants and included a ""safety valve"" feature which allowed the companies to buy emission offsets from environmental programs rather than make the reductions in their own facilities. ""You could reduce your emissions or pay into some alternative compliance fund,"" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University professor who helped develop the plan. ""He (Romney) was looking for mechanisms that would still serve the goals of the program but would limit the financial exposure of the regulated firms."" To Pizer, these carbon limits don’t fit the definition of cap and trade. ""Maybe you’d call it the same family, but it’s different because you’re telling each source, ‘here’s what your limit is, but you can buy reductions from these other programs.’ This idea of trying to limit businesses’ exposure from compliance costs is not a feature of cap and trade."" We also talked to Fred Bayles, a former reporter for the Associated Press and USA Today who covered Romney’s administration. He now teaches at Boston University. In Bayles’ opinion, the Massachusetts pollution regulations ""fit the broad definition of cap and trade."" But he added, ""it’s in the eye of the beholder."" We think the emission limits Romney put in place might still raise the hackles of Santorum and other critics of cap and trade. But his program lacked the feature most commonly associated with cap and trade -- namely, an allowance for companies that come in below their emission caps to sell credits to other polluters. The new information adds some helpful details about Romney's position in the past. It is consistent with what we said in our original story, above, that Romney had expressed some support for cap and trade but backed away from it when he declined to sign on to a regional cap and trade pact.",

""My sole intent was to make the point and drive it home with as strong a use of terms as I possibly could while remaining factually accurate,"" he told us. But he wasn’t accurate. Give him credit for admitting that without much fuss. Nevertheless, we should all be more careful when trying to make a connection to something as emotionally charged as the Holocaust.

He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is ""something I would strongly support,"" and even took a hindsight-is-20/20 stance, saying the country ""would be much better off"" if cap and trade had been instituted. That’s favoring it.",

As his evidence, he cites companies moving their oil rigs from the Gulf Coast overseas and a medical device manufacturer cutting more than 1,000 jobs ""because of new Obamacare taxes."" Even if some companies move overseas or cut jobs and attribute those actions to overregulation, that doesn't mean that regulations in the U.S. are among the most difficult in the world. The reports we found ranked the U.S. between 4th and 10th for business climate. Scott, along with other political or business leaders, certainly can point to concerns about the number, cost or impact of regulations. But Scott hasn't proven that our country's regulations are among the most difficult in the world.",
