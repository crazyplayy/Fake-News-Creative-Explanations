The price increase was partly attributed to the invasion of Ukraine as Western countries imposed economic sanctions on Russia for its aggression.

There would have been no certainty that the pipeline could have produced a net increase of 800,000 barrels a day, rather than just transporting oil from Canada that is currently being transported some other way.

 The Rothschild family banking business has had an office in Russia since the 1990s, but it has no oversight over the country’s currency or monetary policies, which are controlled by the Bank of Russia.

The Clinton Foundation said it has never received donations from Ukraine’s government.
