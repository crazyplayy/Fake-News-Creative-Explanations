10 Stanza Inputs:

Poem: 
 Erie Co.'s health commissioner
Gale Burstein, MD
Received a lot of money
More than what we can see.

Her compensations and benefits
exceeded those of the VP
and even Dr. Fauci!
But we don't know all the details, so we can't say for sure
if she really made more.


15 Stanza Input:

 Burstein's compensation in 2020
exceeded that of Pence and Fauci, for sure.
But when you add in the benefits Cuomo and Pence recieve
It's hard to say who made more, that's the allure.


20 Stanza Input:

 Gale Burstein's compensation
Including salary and benefits
reached $532,418 in 2020
 Which is quite a lot, for certain.

Her compensation exceeded
That of Pence, Fauci and Cuomo
But we mustn't be fooled
For they receive other things too.

Housing, transportation and security
Benefits that are large but hard to quantify
If we add them to the calculation
Burstein's compensation doesn't look so bright.
