POLITIFACT COVID CLAIMS

----------------------

Claim: You are 17 times more likely to go to the hospital if you’re not vaccinated, 20 times more likely to die.
Label: True
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/12/jen-psaki/data-suggests-unvaccinated-are-20-times-more-likel/

Summary:
October data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests unvaccinated people are 20 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than those who are vaccinated and boosted.

Researchers in Texas reached the same conclusion looking at September data.

CDC data from November also indicated that unvaccinated people were about 17 times more likely to be hospitalized due to COVID-19 than those who are vaccinated.

Data from the omicron variant-fueled surge in December and January is preliminary and incomplete but early reports from New York City and Seattle suggest a continued and significant gap in the experiences between vaccinated and unvaccinated who become infected.

Poem:
Covid doesn't choose,
friend or foe,
it makes you loose,
from head to toe.

Vaccinated not yet?
If covid you get,
17 times more likely a hospital you'll met,
and 20 times closer you are to death.

Claim: More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol.
Label: Mostly True
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/02/joe-biden/has-covid-19-killed-more-cops-all-other-causes/

Summary:
Two separate groups find that more law enforcement officers died from COVID-19 than all other causes, including gunfire and car accidents.

Corrections officers are included in the tally.

Poem:
What are you going to do,
when Covid comes for you?
Cops on patrol are dying too.
Gunfire and cars accidents, death's job is done,
but the virus, is the new number one.

correction and detection facilities,
those are places where it's easy to spread.
Their officers are in the tallies,
and to high numbers they lead.

Claim: COVID cases in India plummet after government promotes ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine use.
Label: Mostly False
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/21/gateway-pundit/no-proof-drugs-not-approved-us-covid-19-caused-dro/

Summary:
On April 28, India’s government recommended hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medicine for people who are near patients in home isolation who have mild or no COVID-19 symptoms, and suggested the use of ivermectin to treat those patients.

Neither drug is approved in the U.S. for COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization recommend against using them to prevent or to treat the virus.

COVID-19 cases in India began to drop in mid-May after a nearly vertical spike over the previous several weeks.

Poem:
Reality in true,
is not everything you see.
Dropping, the cases began to,
Who knows, maybe because of the tea.

Hydroxy and Ivermectin,
Neither is approved by WHO,
taking them is like a sin,
which you'll regret in time due.

Claim: The survival rate for COVID-19 is over 99% for most age groups.
Label: False
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/06/instagram-posts/why-covid-19-survival-rate-not-over-99/

Summary:
Most people who contract COVID-19 will not die, though an individual should not weigh their own chances of death by looking at national statistics.

The delta variant has lowered the effectiveness of the vaccines, although researchers aren't exactly sure to what extent.

Poem:
I got 99 problems,
and your survival-rate ain't one.
Want to weight your chanches?
National statistics ain't the plan.

New variants adapt,
vaccines effectiveness is snapped, 
Researchers try to set up trap,
but they don't know how big is the wrap.

Claim: The second booster has eight strains of HIV.
Label: Pants on Fire!
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/14/facebook-posts/covid-19-vaccines-do-not-contain-hiv/

Summary:
The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are published and do not include HIV.

The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booster, has the same ingredients. 

Poem:
Every food has recipes,
precious holy grails,
Vaccines fight enemies,
who run off with their tails.

You don't change instructions,
just because the dose is new.
We already made the introductions,
why would HIV be in queue?
