Claim:  Says Dan Forest has missed almost half of the Board of Education meetings during the pandemic.  
Label: true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/30/roy-cooper/cooper-right-about-forest-education-board-attendan/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) faces a challenge from Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R).
In a debate, Cooper said Forest has missed "almost half" of the state's Board of Education meetings, while Forest said he'd been to "almost every one of those meetings."
Records show Forest has missed 46% of the board meetings held since March 10, when Cooper declared a State of Emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
 
Poem: 

A new challenger approaches Forest
Cooper who he believes to surpass
But Cooper wasn't about to be made an ass

Cooper answered back
That during the pandemic
For Forest, missing meetings had become epidemic

Cooper at least work he had
Forest declared that almost all he attended
But only 13 out of 28 he frequented
The only response to the truth was to stay mad

Claim:  Says science shows the physiological effects of wearing masks include hypoxemia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, toxicity and increased muscle tension.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/apr/16/diamond-and-silk/medical-hypotheses-journal-article-lacks-evidence-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The journal cited in the post, Medical Hypotheses, says its purpose is to publish “theoretical papers."
Claims about ill effects from mask wearing such as hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which are listed in the article, have been debunked.
 
Poem: 

A new journal claims to support the truth
But of science there is only the name
Medical Hypotheses as it is called
Decided that masks were to blame
For almost everything, only short of being slewth

Hypoxemia, hypercamia and shortness of breath
Acompanied by toxicity and increased muscle tension
Were all linked to mask wear
For this false allegation the journal deserves detention

Claim:  Dr. Fauci: No reason to be wearing a mask.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/08/facebook-posts/video-shows-outdated-face-mask-guidance-dr-anthony/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 An old video of Dr. Anthony Fauci saying that people don’t need to wear face masks was taken out of context.
Since April, the CDC has recommended face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and Fauci has pushed for their use as well.
 
Poem: 

A recent video displays the acclaimed doctor Fauci
Speaking against masks, stating
"No reason to be wearing mask"
But taking things out of context is frustating

The mentioned video was from 4 months ago
When the pandemic wasn't such a deathblow
Since then masks are advisable
Therefore the label of barely-true is assignable

Claim:  21% of people are having serious adverse events from (the Moderna) vaccine.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/18/blog-posting/video-shared-facebook-inflates-risk-moderna-vaccin/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Moderna’s data shows that 0.5% of people had a serious adverse reaction.
 
Poem: 

With everything being so unstable
We must be careful of misinformation
Since its so propagable
And can light up a nation

False news have been spread
That one fifth of the Moderna vacinated were unwell
But the readers were misled
Only 1 in 200 that was the nutshell

Claim:  Now, they’re doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off.  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-covid-19-testing-airplane/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The CDC is not testing passengers for COVID-19 as they get on or off airplanes and trains.
The federal government is screening certain passengers at 13 airports.
Screening can include looking for symptoms, but it’s not the same as a test.
 
Poem: 

Once again discussing Donald Trump
Not sure if suffering from a bump
Stated that transportation hubs were being tested
That for passengers COVID-19 tests were being requested

In reality only screenings were carried out
For symptoms to flag
The only thing you need to worry is with jet-lag
So no miss-information needs to be spout
