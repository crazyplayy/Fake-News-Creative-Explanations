Claim:  Bill Gates calls for the withdrawal of all Covid-19 Vaccines; ‘The vaccines are far more dangerous than anyone imagined.’  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/sep/07/blog-posting/no-bill-gates-didnt-call-withdrawal-all-covid-19-v/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  There is no evidence Bill Gates called for the “withdrawal of all COVID-19 vaccines.” 
 The claim comes from an article that was prominently labeled as “satire” after misinformation spread about the piece.
 The Gates Foundation advocates for COVID-19 vaccines on its website.
 
Poem:

Through a magic box
He made dollars in packs
So much money in fact
Can not find a way to relax

But don't worry
He aims to do good
Don't believe in comedy
He took the jab, to show you should

Claim:  Italy drastically reduced the country’s official COV1D-19 death count over 97%. This means Covid killed fewer people than an average seasonal flu.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/10/facebook-posts/italy-didnt-lower-its-covid-19-death-toll-over-97-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Italy didn’t lower its COVID-19 death count by over 97%. The country’s official death toll exceeds 132,000 people.
The claim misconstrues a recent report by the Italian National Institute of Health that highlighted the most common diseases people already had when they died after contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. An agency spokesperson called the claim “completely wrong.”
Pre-existing conditions are a known risk factor for COVID-19, and the agency said its analysis shows that the disease is the direct cause of death in 89% of people who test positive for the virus.
 
Poem: 
Gellato, pizza and pasta
Gifts from Italy to the world
But then the diseases come
They too get twirled.

There are no miracles
Not even in saint peter's land.
Misfortunes never come singly
Get it, and death will leave you strand.

Claim:  Lists eight wealthy politicians and public figures who got millions (or close to it) in PPP loans.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/13/facebook-posts/fact-checking-which-trump-supporters-and-allies-go/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a loan that’s aimed at incentivizing businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Facebook post correctly characterizes how Kanye West, Jared Kushner’s family and Rep. Roger Williams are connected to companies that received money from that program.
However, the post oversimplifies how Elaine Chao, Brad Parscale, Betsy DeVos and Devin Nunes benefited.
 
Poem: 

Salads are healthy
But not at every cost
If you mix the wrong things
All good is lost

An so, beware the walls of text
Which entangle truth with lies
Then you will be able to see
Even the biggest guise

Claim:  There s over a trillion dollars of money unspent from previous (coronavirus) relief bills ... still sitting in a bank account.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/23/steve-scalise/has-1-trillion-covid-19-relief-gone-unspent/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 About $1 trillion remains to be disbursed, but a large share of it has been allocated or is scheduled to be spent.
Most of the unspent money was approved in late December, and it takes time to distribute it.
As the economy recovers, some of the money might not be spent.
 
Poem: 

Money buys everythinhg
So they say
And even you if don't believe it 
You don't want to misspay

So please take your time
Everybody has a plan
And before you blink your eyes
The spending has begun

Claim:  The CDC said that 75% of COVID-19 deaths have involved people with at least four comorbidities.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/24/aaron-rodgers/aaron-rodgers-repeats-debunked-cdc-data-covid-19-d/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The CDC didn’t find that 75% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in individuals who had at least four other illnesses or diseases, known as comorbidities. The figure is based on a study of 1.2 million fully vaccinated people that found around 78% of deaths in the group occurred in people with four or more other illnesses, bolstering the argument that vaccines work.
The claim started circulating in mid-January after an edited clip of an ABC "Good Morning America” interview with CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky cut off part of her quote, omitting the context that the study involved only vaccinated people.
 
Poem: 
Words are powerful
And interpretations can hurt
If you dont pay attention
With danger you flirt

And so the good turns bad
The science to fear
What was once a blessing
Now deserves a sneer
