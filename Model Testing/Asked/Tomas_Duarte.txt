Summary Explanation: 
 Experts said Joe Biden’s claim that a different pandemic response from President Donald Trump would have prevented every coronavirus death goes too far.
A more robust handling of the pandemic would likely have seen the country’s death count significantly reduced, but not to zero, experts said.
Even countries that have found relative success managing the coronavirus — such as South Korea and New Zealand — have seen some deaths.

Claim:  The Lancet peer-reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy, not as 95% stated the vaccine companies, but as: AstraZeneca 1.3%; Moderna 1.2%; J&J 1.2%; Pfizer 0.84%.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/28/instagram-posts/instagram-post-misleads-vaccine-efficacy-conflatin/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A viral Instagram post claiming the COVID-19 vaccines are far less effective than advertised is conflating different measures of efficacy to leave a misleading impression.
The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective. The Pfizer vaccine’s 95% efficacy, for example, means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had a 95% lower risk of becoming infected than those who received a placebo.
A separate measure of vaccine efficacy was the subject of a Lancet Microbe commentary — not a peer-reviewed study. The commentary did not argue that the vaccines do not work, or that the widely reported efficacy figures were inaccurate. An author of the commentary told PolitiFact that the Instagram post misinterprets it.
