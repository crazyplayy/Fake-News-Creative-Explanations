Claim:  Canada has just criminalized all CV19 measures requiring masks, distancing, quarantining & vaccines.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/11/facebook-posts/no-canada-did-not-criminalize-covid-19-restriction/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  The Canadian government has not enacted a law that criminalizes COVID-19 restrictions or prevents enforcement of those guidelines.
 There are places in Canada where you can be fined for disobeying COVID-19 public health orders. 
 The post appears to be referring to a proclamation issued by a “council of citizens’ assemblies.”

Claim:  Says Joe Biden is restricting travel for Americans into Mexico, but is keeping the border wide open for illegal aliens to walk right into our country.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/28/tweets/us-mexico-border-not-wide-open-most-people-trying-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 President Joe Biden has continued a policy — initiated by Donald Trump — to restrict Americans’ travel to Mexico, as a way to fight the spread of COVID-19.
The Mexico border is not “wide open” for illegal immigration into the U.S. The vast majority of encounters result in U.S. immigration officials turning people away at the border.

Claim:  U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/13/facebook-posts/leaked-documents-dont-prove-us-hospitals-preparing/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 An infectious disease expert presenting to the American Hospital Association estimated there could be as many as 96 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. in a year.
He encouraged hospitals to prepare for an outbreak of this magnitude.
But there is no indication that hospitals are preparing, covertly, for an outbreak of that magnitude, as this headline suggests.

Claim:  The U.S. had 44 CDC staffers in China to observe what was going on. (President Trump) brought home the vast majority of them, I think left only four in place.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/21/joe-biden/under-donald-trump-key-cdc-us-staff-china-fell-0/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The correct figures from the CDC show that overall staffing fell but remained higher than what Biden said.
The numbers also show the elimination of all U.S. staff to counter the threat posed by the new coronavirus.

Claim:  In North Carolina, you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/26/facebook-posts/facebook-post-wrong-about-wearing-mask-carrying-co/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A viral Facebook post said "you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.”
A North Carolina law does prohibit people from covering their faces in public.
But that law is currently suspended. And, even if it weren't suspended, experts say it wouldn't affect concealed carry laws.
