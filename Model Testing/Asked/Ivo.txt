Claim:  40 years of research, and no vaccine for HIV. At least 100 years of research and no vaccine for cancer. Ongoing research and no vaccine for the common cold. Now in less than a year, there s a vaccine for COVID-19?  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/10/facebook-posts/fact-checking-facebook-post-comparing-covid-19-vac/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Despite decades of research, there is no vaccine against HIV given unique challenges the virus poses, such as rapid mutations that are difficult for the immune system to adapt to.
There are some vaccines to prevent and even treat some cancers, but not all cancers are caused by a virus.
There are many different rhinoviruses that can cause the common cold. That makes it difficult for researchers to create a vaccine that can address them all.
Governments around the world have invested in companies to help speed up a COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines up for FDA evaluation have characteristics that allow them to be produced faster than other commonly known vaccines.
