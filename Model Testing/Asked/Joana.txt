Claim:  A six-month study from Pfizer shows that its vaccine reduces severe COVID symptoms/hospitalizations .1%.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/17/instagram-posts/instagram-post-incorrectly-interprets-pfizer-vacci/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be highly effective at preventing severe symptoms from developing in a person infected with COVID-19.
A now deleted Instagram post used incorrect math to claim the Pfizer vaccine is less effective than advertised.
There are two calculations that are used to measure a vaccine's effectiveness: one shows the effect it would have on an individual person while the other shows its impact on a population.

Claim:  It would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S. and halting global warming would cost $300 billion.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/27/facebook-posts/no-consensus-cost-ending-homelessness-us-or-haltin/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 It would likely cost significantly more than $20 billion to house America’s homeless population, after factoring in the expansion of the federal housing voucher program and affordable housing development.
Since models to predict the cost of fighting climate change rely on many different assumptions, estimates vary widely. However, $300 billion is on the very low end of the spectrum. ​

Claim:  Washington’s State Board of Health will discuss mandatory COVID-19 quarantines and vaccine requirements for schoolchildren at a Jan. 12 meeting.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/11/facebook-posts/washington-state-changes-covid-meeting-quarantine/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Washington’s State Board of Health is discussing proposed rule changes to its administrative code, but they are related to HIV language, not to quarantine or isolation policies.
The proposed changes do not suggest that law enforcement be used to enforce COVID-19 vaccination.
There is no vote scheduled on requiring COVID-19 vaccines for children to attend school. An advisory group assigned to make a recommendation on that subject is expected to give an update on its progress.

None of the studies found that hydroxychloroquine made a difference.

Label: half-true

Summary Explanation: 
 The article cites data primarily about one Australian state, New South Wales.
The vast majority of the vaccine-eligible population in New South Wales is vaccinated against COVID-19, reaching 93%.
Coupled with the fact that more than 50% of those in the ICU with COVID-19 were unvaccinated, experts say, the figures demonstrate the vaccines’ effectiveness in preventing severe illness.
