Claim:  Nurse passes out on live TV after taking vaccine.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/21/facebook-posts/anti-vaccine-video-fainting-nurse-lacks-context/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A nurse in Tennessee did become dizzy and was assisted to the ground after taking a COVID-19 vaccine.
The nurse recovered and later said that her dizziness is something that regularly happens to her after experiencing any kind of pain, even after stubbing a toe.
Becoming dizzy after a vaccine is not unusual for some people, a doctor said. The doctor dismissed the notion that the episode was indicative of something dangerous in the vaccine.

Claim:  Amid COVID-19, 25 of the 26 Republican governors have decided to play football, but three-fourths of the 24 Democratic governors have decided not to play already and most will probably not play.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/aug/19/tommy-tuberville/senate-hopeful-tommy-tuberville-fumbles-facts-abou/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 It’s not governors but collegiate athletic conferences and universities themselves that are deciding whether their teams play football this fall.
Colleges in a given state can belong to different conferences — so, some might be in conferences that have canceled football, while others are in conferences that have not.
Only 17 states with teams in the top tier of college football have none of those teams playing this fall. That includes 13 states with Democratic governors and four with GOP governors.

Claim:  Cases, numbers and deaths (of COVID-19) are going down all over the Country!  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/28/donald-trump/are-coronavirus-cases-going-down-all-over-us/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  Nationally, the data show a shrinking number of new daily infections and deaths. That downward pattern is also being mirrored in many states.
 However, some states are bucking that general pattern and seeing a rising number of new daily cases over time. This suggests a patchwork pattern where the coronavirus is accelerating in some places even as its spread is slowing overall.
 In the states that are seeing a rising number of new daily infections, the rise is not as rapid as it was earlier in the pandemic.
