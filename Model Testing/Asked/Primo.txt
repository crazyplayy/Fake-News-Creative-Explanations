Claim:  Herd immunity is probably why California has far fewer COVID-19 deaths than New York.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/21/facebook-posts/herd-immunity-curbed-covid-deaths-no/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Once a high percentage of people have been infected with a virus or vaccinated — in other words, herd immunity is achieved — spread of the virus can be stopped or greatly slowed.
Despite having a population twice that of New York State, California has experienced only a fraction of the number of COVID-19 deaths.
There’s no evidence herd immunity has limited coronavirus deaths in California, which adopted stay-at-home measures before New York did.

Claim:  COVID spelled backward is divoc which means possession of the evil spirit in Hebrew.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/11/facebook-posts/covid-spelled-backward-divoc-which-means-possessio/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 “Divoc” is not a Hebrew word.
The closest existing word in the language is “dibbuk,” which means evil possession, but the two are not the same, linguistic experts said.
COVID-19 is an abbreviation of "coronavirus disease 2019.” "CO" stands for "corona," "VI" stands for "virus" and "D" stands for "disease." The number 19 reflects the year it was identified — 2019.

Claim:  WHO Director-General: The vaccines are being used to kill children.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/dec/23/tweets/twitter-post-misconstrues-what-who-director-genera/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stumbled over his words, first mispronouncing the word “children” with “kil/cil.” He then corrected himself and pronounced the word “children.” That led some people to claim he said “kill children.”
WHO supports the use of vaccines for children and says that there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine has killed children.

Claim:  Says it was unquestionably not within his legal authority to postpone Illinois’ primary election changing the date or shifting to vote- -mail.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/24/jb-pritzker/did-pritzker-lack-authority-postpone-illinois-prim/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 It’s difficult to know for sure that Pritzker could not have done anything to delay the March 17 election.
But experts told us the governor spoke correctly in describing the limits of his powers under existing law.
