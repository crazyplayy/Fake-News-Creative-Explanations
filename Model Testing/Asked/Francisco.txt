Summary Explanation: 
 The operator of the charging station said it gets its power through the local utility company, not diesel.
Electric car charging stations do not typically run on a diesel generator. Charging stations are connected to an electrical grid supplied by whatever the local power source is.
A diesel generator was used in an experiment to power an electric car charging station. The experiment found that a car charged through the station was more fuel efficient than driving a diesel-powered car.

Claim:  COVID-19’s contagion probability between two people is 70% if the carrier is not masked, 5% if the carrier is masked, and 1.5% if both parties are.

Summary Explanation: 
 Epidemiologists seem to agree that the scientific studies necessary to quantify the exact percentage of contagion risk have not been done — making numbers advanced by this image are questionable.
​The same scientists, however, agreed that the message communicated by this image is on target.

Claim:  Haiti, Tanzania and Madagascar refused the COVID-19 vaccines and now all three of their presidents have died unexpectedly.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/12/facebook-posts/theres-no-evidence-these-politicians-were-killed-o/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 There is no evidence that the deaths of Jovenel Moïse, John Magufuli and Didier Ignace Ratsiraka were connected to their governments’ refusing COVID-19 vaccines.
Moïse was the only one assassinated, and experts say his death will likely only further hinder the vaccine effort in Haiti, not help it.
Ratsiraka was not Madagascar’s president at the time of his death. His last term ended in 2002.

Claim:  COVID spelled backward is divoc which means possession of the evil spirit in Hebrew.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/11/facebook-posts/covid-spelled-backward-divoc-which-means-possessio/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 “Divoc” is not a Hebrew word.
The closest existing word in the language is “dibbuk,” which means evil possession, but the two are not the same, linguistic experts said.
COVID-19 is an abbreviation of "coronavirus disease 2019.” "CO" stands for "corona," "VI" stands for "virus" and "D" stands for "disease." The number 19 reflects the year it was identified — 2019.

Summary Explanation: 
 Joe Biden did not directly say that he thought President Donald Trump shouldn’t have restricted travel from China to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Biden did accuse Trump of "xenophobia" in an Iowa campaign speech the same day that the administration announced the travel restrictions — Jan. 31 — but his campaign said his remarks were not related, and that he made similar comments before the restrictions were imposed.
