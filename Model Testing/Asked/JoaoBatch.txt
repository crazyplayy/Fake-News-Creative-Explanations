Summary Explanation: 
 Kirk’s tweet gets some things right, but includes inaccurate details, like the number of people with symptoms and whether individuals were quarantined.
The tweet is also missing a key detail: All three people were medically cleared.

Claim:  The CDC was normalizing blood clots tweeting about the health condition before the Super Bowl.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/15/facebook-posts/no-cdc-wasnt-normalizing-blood-clots-its-super-bow/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Well before COVID-19 existed, the CDC had tweeted out warnings about blood clots.
Blood clots are common, affecting about 900,000 Americans each year, and can be deadly.
There is not an increased risk of blood clots from the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, the only other COVID-19 vaccine used in the U.S., has been linked to rare cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).

Claim:  Says professional soccer player Christian Eriksen received the Pfizer vaccine days before he collapsed during a game.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/14/instagram-posts/christian-eriksen-danish-soccer-player-who-collaps/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Danish soccer player Christian Eriksen, 29, suddenly collapsed June 12 during a UEFA European Championship match between Denmark and Finland. He was later reported to be stable at the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest.
The director of Eriksen’s professional team said he hadn’t received any COVID-19 vaccine or previously contracted the disease.
A small number of younger people have developed heart inflammation after receiving an mRNA-based vaccine. The possible link is currently being investigated by health agencies, including the CDC.

Claim:  In the U.S., myocarditis cases among ages 12 to 20 numbered four in 2019; four in 2020; and 2,236 in 2021.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/31/facebook-posts/social-media-claim-misleads-risk-myocarditis/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
   The risk of myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, from COVID-19 vaccines is small and symptoms are normally mild. But contracting COVID-19 is “a strong and significant risk factor for myocarditis,” especially among children under 16 years old, according to the CDC.
 Professional medical groups and federal public health agencies have said the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risks.

Claim:  Thalidomide was FDA-approved for pregnant women in the 1960s.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/30/facebook-posts/thalidomide-morning-sickness-drug-caused-disabilit/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Thalidomide was prescribed around the world as a drug to treat nausea during pregnancy. It was directly linked to thousands of children being born with severe physical disabilities.
The FDA reviewed an application for thalidomide in the early 1960s, but withheld approval amid concerns about the evidence of its effectiveness and reports of side effects. The application was withdrawn.
The case led to a tightening of regulations for FDA drug reviews.

Claim:  Says Dr. Anthony Fauci s name appears on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein used to create the current COVID-19 epidemic.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/12/jerome-corsi/conspiracy-theorist-spreads-false-claim-about-fauc/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and conspiracy theorist, wrote on his blog that Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appears on four patents for a protein linked to the novel coronavirus.
Three of the patents Corsi cited are active. They deal with a potential treatment for HIV and are owned by the Department of Health and Human Services.
There is no credible evidence that COVID-19 is related to HIV or was created in a lab. The coronavirus’ genetic makeup precludes the possibility that it was man-made.

Claim:  We’ve got to give the American public a rough estimate of how long we think this is going to take, based mostly on the South Korean model, which seems to be the trajectory that we are on, thankfully, and not the Italian model.  
Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/01/brian-fitzpatrick/pa-congressman-said-us-coronavirus-trajectory-more/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A Pennsylvania congressman said the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. matches the spread of the virus in South Korea, not Italy. The U.S. and South Korea have similar case fatality rates – Italy’s is higher – but all three countries have age-specific mortality rates that are about the same.
Public health experts say the fatality rate wouldn’t be the only or the most important metric used to determine when businesses may reopen.The growth in cases and hospitals’ capacity to treat new patients is the most important factor.

Summary Explanation: 
 Regarding how to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tuberville did say once he “wouldn’t have a clue” and another time said, “I don’t know which way you go.”
Tuberville has not laid out a plan for addressing the virus, though he has taken some positions on shutdowns and emergency aid, and the need to resume school and athletics.

Summary Explanation: 
 Net worth data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics for 2018, the most recent year available, shows that almost two-thirds of U.S. senators’ net worth exceeds $1 million.
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, are the body’s wealthiest lawmakers. Each reported a net worth of more than $200 million dollars, the data show.
Fifty-seven lawmakers reported net worths of between $1 million and $100 million, including Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, who is worth about $2 million, the data show.

Summary Explanation: 
 The connections the post claims are wrong. Fauci is more than 14 years older than Gates and had already graduated from Cornell and was working at the NIH when Gates was in college.
Gates did not attend Cornell and did not room with Fauci.
IG Farben is not connected to Moderna.
Fauci was never CEO of Moderna.
Epstein was not the primary stockholder of Moderna when he died.

Label: half-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/13/facebook-posts/fact-checking-which-trump-supporters-and-allies-go/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a loan that’s aimed at incentivizing businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Facebook post correctly characterizes how Kanye West, Jared Kushner’s family and Rep. Roger Williams are connected to companies that received money from that program.
However, the post oversimplifies how Elaine Chao, Brad Parscale, Betsy DeVos and Devin Nunes benefited.

Summary Explanation: 
 Multiple professional athletes like Kyrie Irving, Charlie Beljan and Caster Semenya have been banned, in one form or another, from competing in their sports for refusing to take medication or get the COVID-19 vaccine.
Some sporting organizations are issuing vaccine mandates, too. The Olympic committees for Canada and the United States announced that athletes must be fully vaccinated against the virus if they want to compete at the 2022 Winter Olympics.
Tennis Australia didn't ban Djokovic from playing. He was deported because of Australia's COVID-19 policies.

Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/states-do-use-masks-contain-covid-19-prisons/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Experts agree that wearing facial coverings in close settings provides some measure of protection against spreading the coronavirus.
Despite a claim on Facebook, New York, Michigan and California prisons all are providing masks to inmates, as well as staff, as part of their COVID-19 response.
Certain groups of inmates are being freed early as a way to try to limit the spread of COVID-19. They include pregnant women with less than six months left on sentences for nonviolent offenses, and other inmates who are either over 60 with health issues or months away from being eligible for parole.

Label: barely-true

Summary Explanation: 
 Production of a lithium-ion battery for an electric vehicle emits carbon dioxide equivalent to operating a gasoline car for about one or two years, depending on where the battery is produced.
The carbon emission from battery production can be quickly offset once an electric car is in operation, because it has no tailpipe emissions.

Summary Explanation: 
 Claims that millions of people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine are unfounded. The claim is based on a misreading of sources that include the U.S. government’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and Europe’s EudraVigilance databases
Both systems are federal databases in which any potential adverse health effects from vaccines and medicines are reported.
Both systems warn that reports do not prove on their own that a vaccine caused an adverse health event, and should not be used as a primary source.

Summary Explanation: 
 U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) cited a New York Times graphic showing that the 26 million people who filed for unemployment equalled the total workforce of a combined 25 states.
The total U.S. workforce is about 160 million people, so 26 million is not half of that.
The economy can also be measured by trends in the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. But experts said they don't expect GDP to fall 50%.
