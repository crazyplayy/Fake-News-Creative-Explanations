 Pro-Kremlin accounts were quick
To bolster the claim that Ukraine was to blame,
By posting a video that was fake,
That didn't come from the BBC.

The claim was easily spread
Because it supported the old claim
That Ukraine was to blame
For civilian deaths at the train station.

Although this claim was quick
To be spread around,
There's no concrete evidence
That Ukraine was to blame.

For example,
Russia has used Tochka-U
Recently,
So the serial number on it
Doesn't prove anything.
