 With their kids grudgingly going back to school,
They’re relieved they can take off their own mask:
They are so relieved they are singing aloud.
But there’s one thing they’d better not do:
 
 Brag how all of their kids are at school unmasked.
There are some kids who are still wearing their mask,
And they’ll know whose kids are back in class unmasked.
Be careful, you parents who’ve been unmasked;
 
 There’s still work to do—keep the mask on at school!
Though “back to normal” may sound like the whole truth,
There are still kids who have not gone back to school.
So let’s save the song for later on down the road—
For now, just be careful and keep your mouths shut.
