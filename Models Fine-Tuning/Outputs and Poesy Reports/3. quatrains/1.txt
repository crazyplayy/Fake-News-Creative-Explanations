 A Ukranian pilot, a hero of the skies,
Stops at nothing to down his foe;
His name, revealed by his mother in a boast,
Is Samuyil Hyde.

He’s not a comedian, nor even a ghost,
Nor Hyde (maybe) but Samuyil;
If you should encounter him and he should shoot,
It’s not because he’s in a mood.

It’s not because the world’s gone mad. It’s not
Because his name is Samuyil.
It’s just because he’s Ukrainian, and pissed.
That’s all. Don’t blame Hyde.
