 Couldn’t catch my cold, it seems.
I did my best, but—oops!
I’m in the ER, and now
I’ve got a fungal lung.
 
Though I wore a mask,
I’ve learned that masks can mask
an infection that
won’t go away, no mask
 
a mask will stop, but not
the one that’s got me now,
a fungal lung, and none
of this is fake news.
