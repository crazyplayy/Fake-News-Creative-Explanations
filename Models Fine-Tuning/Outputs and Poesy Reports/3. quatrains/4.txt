 Nearby, a child is wailing.
His mother tries to smile.
“It’s only ‘flu,” she’s telling.
“He’ll be okay, I guess.”

“No, I’m fine,” the tot is saying.
“I just feel sick today.
Just give me chicken soup, mama.
I’ll be okay, I guess.”

“Son,” his dad is saying,
“You’ve got to wear that mask.
There’s lots of people out there.
You’re just a guess, I know.”
