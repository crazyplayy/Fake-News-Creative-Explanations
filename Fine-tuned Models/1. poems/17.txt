 Differences between candidates
shouldn’t be ignored.
Though the similarities are true,
the differences are too.

On taxes,
there is a lot to discuss,
Sanders want to increase
the taxes for the rich.
Biden on the other hand,
isn’t too fond of more quids
in the pockets of the plebs.

On free college tuition,
there’s a divide between them,
Sanders want to pay for it
through the income crime.
FULL STOP!
Biden is on the record
of being against it.
