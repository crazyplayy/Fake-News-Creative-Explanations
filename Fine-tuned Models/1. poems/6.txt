 Would you like to have a dime for every time someone mentionned the GDP? 
It would make no difference to your wallet.
But if you ever had the chance to earn it,
you would surely take it!  

Since the only thing we know for sure is that more money equals more action,
the solution would be to just end homelessness
and halt the global warming.

If you want to achieve these goals,
you need to invest in your people,
and it might cost a few billion.
