 Polar bears may be decreasing,
but they still have our respect.
Coz they are still worth our care,
and they are not yet in their end.

Today their numbers are low,
due to climate change and other doings.
Coz their ice is their place,
and ice is what they are losings.  

Whales once were the stars,
but their numbers are now the scars.
Experts say that their recovery isn't close,
and their numbers will never recover.
Birds of pray are being down,
due to wind turbines and their downings.
However, it's not true,
like the other things in this poem.
