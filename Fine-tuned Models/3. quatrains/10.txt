 Normalcy is masklessness,
Which in our age is hard to find.
Though a few places are exempt,
Most are forced to keep on frowning.

Though some kids now might be unbanned,
Others must keep to mask-wearing;
With our nation’s leaders loony,
Life can hardly be normal.

Though in some states there’s a reprieve,
Restraining mandates are widespread;
Wear your mask in peace (they advise):
Such is hardly normal.

If this craze should one day be gone,
And the nation become un-sick,
We may truly celebrate,
Praising Normalcy, our mother.
