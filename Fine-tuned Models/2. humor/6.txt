 “It would cost $20 billion to house our homeless,”
Claims someone, who should know;
But never mind the billions: think of me
(The smallest unit), still on the streets.

I’m cold, I’m hungry, and I’m sick at heart:
They’re cold and hungry, too,
And sicker, not to mention homeless,
As homeless as me.

The world will cost $300 billion to reclaim
From carbon and its blight;
But cost’s the least of what it’s costing us:
I cost you five.

I cost you five.
