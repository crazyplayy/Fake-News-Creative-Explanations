 This week, when I went to the beach,
I drove my car, not my bike;
I would have taken a plane,
But that would have been too late.
The virus’s getting so bad
That air travel is trash.
I could have taken the train,
But Amtrak’s just trash.
I stayed at a hotel,
But that’s trash, too, and costly;
I’d have liked to have camped out,
But that’s trash, too, and smelly.
The cost of my trip? Trash.
