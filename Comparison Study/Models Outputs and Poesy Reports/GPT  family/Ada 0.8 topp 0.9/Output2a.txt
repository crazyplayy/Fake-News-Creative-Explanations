The man in the mugshot
was not responsible for lighting 32 of the wildfires on the West Coast.
He was arrested in July 2018 and is currently in prison for lighting nine fires in southwest California,
including the Cranston Fire, which forced thousands of evacuations and burned over 13,000 acres.
 Experts say that climate change has modified environments in the West Coast, meaning they are more conducive to wildfires.
