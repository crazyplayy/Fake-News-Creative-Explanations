False claims circulate,
telling of a failed product,
That's only used as a last resort.
The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines
Is seen in the higher infection rates, 
spread, hospitalization and death.
It's common to give boosters,
To maintain or lengthen the protection 
Provided by an initial vaccination.
