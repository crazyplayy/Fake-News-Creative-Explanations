There are children who are almost immune to COVID-19,
but that doesn't mean everyone is.
7.3% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S,
and less than 0.1% of deaths,
according to the CDC.
Many children were not exposed to the virus as much as adults because schools shut down nationwide in March.
Research in other countries that reopened schools shows children can catch COVID-19.
