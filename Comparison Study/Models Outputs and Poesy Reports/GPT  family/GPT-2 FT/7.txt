Claim:  We inherited a country where 4% was the new peak unemployment.
Label: half-true
Summary Explanation:
The 4% figure used to track net job growth under President Donald Trump is not a new measurement.
The US government first began publishing such data in May 2020, when the national unemployment rate was 8.1% but was declining.
Since then, the rate has fallen 25% and is now at a 25-year low.

Poem:
We inherited a country where 4% was the new peak,
but it was still not the worst.

Label: pants-fire
Summary Explanation:
The CDC is not testing passengers for COVID-19 as they get on or off airplanes and trains.
The federal government is screening certain passengers at 13 airports.

Poem:
Once again discussing Donald Trump
Not sure if suffering from a bump
Stated that transportation hubs were being tested
That for passengers COVID-19
