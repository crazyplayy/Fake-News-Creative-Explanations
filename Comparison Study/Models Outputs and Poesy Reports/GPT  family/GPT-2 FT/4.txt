Reality in true,
is not everything you see.
Sometimes things are expressed
for effect,
Not to be believed.

COVID-19 cases in China,
and cases in the U.S.
Were both higher,
but not to the same degree.

Still, not all that glitters is gold,
and don't let the voiceovers get you mislead,
carried away by the hype.

Claim:  The Biden administration inherited gains of 50,000 jobs a month. We re now finally back to 500,000 jobs a month. We inherited a country where 4,000 people a day were dying from Covid. That s now down 75%.
Label: half-true
Summary Explanation:
 The Biden administration can trumpet improvements in both employment and the coronavirus pandemic, but Klain’s numbers are off. 
 The average monthly job gains under Biden are almost twice as big as they were late in the Trump administration, but not 10 times bigger, as Klain suggested. 
 The rate of coronavirus deaths has fallen by 61%, not 75%, on Biden’s watch.

Poem:
Improvements were made,
Employment up a grade,
Pandemic numbers in a faze,
Biden administration deserves a praise.

But,
Not all violets are blue,
Klain's numbers are not true.
Biden's numbers might have grew
but Trump actually did something too.

The gains are only twice as big.
You can't compare a log to a twig,
So there's a lot to do
before ten times becomes true.

Although rates have fall,
they are not such a big haul.
Sixty-one is the reality
Not the Seventy-Five plea.

Claim: Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president.

Label: false
Summary Explanation:
Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report receiving any donations from the Ukrainian government or Ukrainian nationals. Those donations would have been illegal.
A spokesperson for Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a 2015 Wall Street Journal graphic that has been frequently misrepresented online. The chart shows donations to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and
