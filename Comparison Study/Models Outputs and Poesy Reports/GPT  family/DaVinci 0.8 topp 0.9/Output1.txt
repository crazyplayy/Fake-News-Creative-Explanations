The government gave Gilead money,
paid for their development of remdesivir.
$34.5 million to be exact.
When they found out it could treat Ebola,
it was given to them in the hopes that they would succeed.

And succeed they did,
but at what cost?

The NIH gave them a grant for $6 million,
to help them speed up the process.
And then another $30 million
to see how it worked against COVID-19.

All of this money came from taxpayers,
and now the drug is being sold for $3,120 per vial.
