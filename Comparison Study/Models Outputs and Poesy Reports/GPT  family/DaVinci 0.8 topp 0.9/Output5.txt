 Common to give boosters,
to maintain protection,
initial vaccination just an introduction.

Covid-19 vaccines have higher infection rates,
spread, hospitalization and death among unvaccinated people.

There is such thing as a booster,
a failed product is not reused,
that would be absurd and fruitless.
