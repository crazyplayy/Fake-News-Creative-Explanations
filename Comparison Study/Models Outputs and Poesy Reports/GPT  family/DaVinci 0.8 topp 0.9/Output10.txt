 New York, New York,
the city that never sleeps.
COVID-19 hit them hard,
and now they're in too deep.

Different lockdown orders,
the virus still flourishes.
More cases, more deaths,
and now more hospitalizations.

The Empire State falls,
as the Sunshine State stands.
But we mustn't forget,
that New York is where it all began.
