 Sipping water every 20 minutes,
to prevent coronavirus? that's absurd!
And if you think that's bad,
just wait 'til you hear the rest.

Exposing your clothing to the sun,
to kill the virus? please, no one!
And don't forget to wash your hands,
but not every 20 minutes, as the message commands.
