Coronavirus: 
A bad disease,
not as bad as it sounds.
It’s a plague that kills the old,
but leaves the young alone.

A disease that’s worse than the flu,
But less than the flu and the common cold.

It’s not so bad, but you must wear a mask,
and avoid public places. 

COVID-19, the disease is still killing people,
and they’re not just the old.

Poem: 
 Covid-19 is a disease,
It’s not a virus,
