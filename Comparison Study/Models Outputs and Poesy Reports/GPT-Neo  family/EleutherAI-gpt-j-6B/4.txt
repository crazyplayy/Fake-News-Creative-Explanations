Children are not immune,
but still,
theyâ€™re not a big threat.

Children represent
about 7.3% of cases,
and less than 0.1% of deaths,
according to the CDC. 

Many children were not
exposed to the virus as much
as adults because schools shut
down nationwide in March. 

Research in other countries
that reopened schools
shows children can catch
COVID-19.
