We are all afraid of the coronavirus, 
and we are all afraid of the Sun. 
We are all afraid of water, 
but not of the Sun. 
The coronavirus is more like the Sun, 
and less like water.
 
The Sun is hot, 
but not as hot as the coronavirus. 
The Sun shines on everyone, 
but not everyone is as contagious as the coronavirus. 
The coronavirus is more contagious than the Sun, 
but less hot than the Sun.
