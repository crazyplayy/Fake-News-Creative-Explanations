Write me a poem for a given summary taking into account the claim and the label     Claim: Says Joe Biden risks war with
 Russia because Vladimir Putin doesn’t “believe in transgender rights.“   Label: pants-fire   Summary Explanation:    Oh
io Senate candidate JD Vance said the State Department’s focus on transgender rights is inflaming the conflict with Russ
ia in Ukraine.  Russia has placed as many as 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders.  Russia has said Ukraine’s ties to N
ATO are a key threat to Russia’s national security.   Poem:    Nato is a threat for Putin,   almost as transgenders are
for JD Vance.  150,000 troops near the borders?  it’s fair to assume one in charge has a disorder.  Transgender or cisge
nder,  doesn’t define an offender.   Biden claims Ukraine’s safety,  Putin’s heart only knows obscurity.       Claim: Th
e US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.   Label: true   Summary Expla
nation:    When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the United States has made progress, decreasing emissions 8.2% fro
m 2010 to 2019.   Among other  top emitters, Brazil made the most progress for that time period, with an emission decrea
se of 31.3%, but is now on the rise.   But China and India saw major increases, of 25.4% and 36.6% respectively.   Poem:
    Co2, our little “Frienemy”,  you and the other greenhouse gases  need to leave, desperately!    The US set an exampl
e for once,  decreasing their emissions 8.2%  Brazil follows their example, but are struggling with the maintenance,  wh
ile China and India counter the occident.       Claim: Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was runni
ng for president.     Label: false   Summary Explanation:    Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report
 receiving any donations from the Ukrainian government or Ukrainian nationals. Those donations would have been illegal.
 A spokesperson for Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a 2015 Wall Street Journal graphic that has been frequently misrepresen
ted online. The chart shows donations to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014 by the nationality of the individu
als who made them; it does not say anything about donations to the foundation by foreign governments.   The Clinton Foun
dation said it has never received donations from Ukraine’s government.   Poem:    In 2016, Hillary ran for president,  N
o reports of donations from Ukraine were evident.  Those donations would’ve been illegal,  Truthful reports would’ve bee
n a miracle.  Graphics misrepresented,  Can affect one’s reputation,  Clinton Foundation received individual donations
Never from Ukraine’s government,  That was an incident.       Claim:  The second booster has eight strains of HIV.    La
bel: pants-fire   Summary Explanation:     The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are published and do not include HIV.
The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booste
r, has the same ingredients.      Poem:    Every food has recipes,  precious holy grails,  Vaccines fight enemies,  who
run off with their tails.    You don't change instructions,  just because the dose is new.  We already made the introduc
tions,  why would HIV be in queue?       Claim: Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun   Label:
false   Summary Explanation:    Harvard researchers proposed a small-scale experiment that would spray aerosols into the
 atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. The experiment wo
uld measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology.  The experiment is funded in part through Harvard’s Solar Geo
engineering Research Program, and Bill Gates is among the donors to that program.  The claim first surfaced in 2021 and
has been previously debunked.   Poem:    yeah is hot,  glaciers are no longer in stock,  Bill Gates a solution tried to
find,  but block only works on intagram, bear this in mind.    Now, the true story,  Bill, you don´t deserver the glory!
  Havard was the one, the original author  You only gave them money and they took the offer.       Claim:  The New York
City Police Department arrested a 9-year-old because she didn’t have a vaccine card in the museum.    Label: false   Sum
mary Explanation:     The 9-year-old was not arrested. She was escorted to the police station in a separate car from tho
se who were arrested — a group which included her mother — and cared for by police officers until her mother was release
d.    The adults were arrested and charged with trespassing because they would not leave the museum after it closed.
 Poem:    Kids like to fool around  making jokes and pranks,  but they are not robbing banks  in a museum, goons ain't f
ound.    This kid was escorted  to the police station,  there she was supported  and cared with attention.    She ended
up there,  because mom was in a group  that police arrested fair.  The museum floor needs to be swoop  Time's over for p
hotos and stare.    COVID-19 or card vaccine,  have no part in this.  Manipulation is no sin,  but trespassing is.
 Claim: Ethnic Russians face “genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.”   Label: false   Summary Explanation:    Despite
 multiple claims of a Ukrainian genocide against ethnic Russians, there is no evidence to support it.  International bod
ies that include Russian representatives report that civilian deaths have plummeted since 2014.  Russia’s ambassador to
the U.S. relied on misleading and outdated evidence to back the claim.   Poem:    No evidence, no case,  Claims are made
 to incriminate.  Russia’s Ambassador was mislead,   Those reports weren’t going to succeed.  Since 2014 deaths decrease
d,  There’s no genocide,  Russia just lied.       Claim: The war in Ukraine is “scripted and staged.”   Label: pants-fir
e   Summary Explanation:    News reports, testimonies of citizens-turned-fighters, and a swift global response all fly i
n the face of baseless claims that Russia’s war on Ukraine is “staged.”   Poem:    Open your eyes,  There’s no place lik
e home.  Ukraine cries,  Russia lies,  Citizens wish to roam.  The inexperienced fighters blood spills like cherry wine,
  “scripted and staged” scream hypocrisy,  We want Putin to resign  And give them a real democracy.        Claim:  Map s
hows states where all of the children… are back to living mask-free, normal lives.    Label: barely-true   Summary Expla
nation:     Though the majority of states do not have statewide school mask mandates, individual school districts still
have mandates.    The absence of state mask rules has not meant a full return to pre-pandemic “normal” at school in most
 places.     Poem:    We all want the same,  to go back to normality,  but like this claim,  that's still not the realit
y.    The majority of states,  do not have statewide   school mask mandates.  However,   individual school districts abi
de  since they still have mandates.    If mask rules evaporated,  that doesn't mean  normality would be stated  in most
schools scene.       Claim:  Gavin Newsom is out of sight likely because he has Guillain-Barre syndrome from his booster
 shot.    Label: false   Summary Explanation:     California Gov. Gavin Newsom received a COVID-19 booster shot on Oct.
27, then, citing family obligations, canceled a planned international trip and did not make public appearances for more
than a week.    Evidence does not support the claim that Newsom has either Guillain-Barre syndrome or Bell's palsy. The
article that makes the claim is based on speculation, conjecture and unnamed sources.    Newsom’s spokesperson said the
governor did not have an adverse reaction to his booster shot.      Poem:    The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,
  The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,  The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,  The vaccine is a booster sho
t,  not a cure.       Claim:  The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,  The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,
The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure,  The vaccine is a booster shot,  not a cure.       Label: pants-fire   Summa
ry Explanation:     The claim that the vaccine is a booster shot, not a cure, is false.   The vaccine is a booster shot,
 not a cure, because it is not a cure.  The vaccine is a booster shot, not a cure, because it is not a cure.  The vaccin
