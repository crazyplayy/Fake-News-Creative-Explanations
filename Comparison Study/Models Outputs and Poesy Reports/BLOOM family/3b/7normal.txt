Write me a poem for a given summary taking into account the claim and the label

 Claim: Bill Gates hatches 'horribly
stupid' plan to block out the sun
 Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

Harvard researchers proposed a small-scale ex
periment that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at m
inimizing global warming. The experiment would measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology.
The experiment is
 funded in part through Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, and Bill Gates is among the donors to that prog
ram.
The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked.
 Poem:

yeah is hot,
glaciers are no longer
 in stock,
Bill Gates a solution tried to find,
but block only works on intagram, bear this in mind.

Now, the true
story,
Bill, you don´t deserver the glory!
Havard was the one, the original author
You only gave them money and they
took the offer. 


 Claim: Ethnic Russians face “genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.”
 Label: false
 Summary Ex
planation:

Despite multiple claims of a Ukrainian genocide against ethnic Russians, there is no evidence to support i
t.
International bodies that include Russian representatives report that civilian deaths have plummeted since 2014.
Ru
ssia’s ambassador to the U.S. relied on misleading and outdated evidence to back the claim.
 Poem:

No evidence, no c
ase,
Claims are made to incriminate.
Russia’s Ambassador was mislead,
 Those reports weren’t going to succeed.
Since
 2014 deaths decreased,
There’s no genocide,
Russia just lied.


 Claim: Russia has never attacked anyone throughou
t its history.
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

Historians cite upwards of a dozen examples dating back to
the 1500s in which Russia or the Soviet Union attacked another country without being militarily attacked first.
 Russia
 may offer various justifications for why it attacked another country in these instances, but each of these examples inv
olved militarily unprovoked actions by Russia or the Soviet Union.

Poem:

Soviet Union or Russia,
the tale is old
as time.
 Historians carry examples,
Russians justifications
But all we see is crime.
Justifications filled with tem
ptations,
 military attacks cause obliterations.


 Claim: Says Joe Biden risks war with Russia because Vladimir Put
in doesn’t “believe in transgender rights.“
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance
 said the State Department’s focus on transgender rights is inflaming the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.
Russia has p
laced as many as 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders.
Russia has said Ukraine’s ties to NATO are a key threat to Russ
ia’s national security.
 Poem:

Nato is a threat for Putin,
 almost as transgenders are for JD Vance.
150,000 troop
s near the borders?
it’s fair to assume one in charge has a disorder.
Transgender or cisgender,
doesn’t define an off
ender.
 Biden claims Ukraine’s safety,
Putin’s heart only knows obscurity.


 Claim:
Map shows states where all of
 the children… are back to living mask-free, normal lives.

Label: barely-true
 Summary Explanation:

 Though the m
ajority of states do not have statewide school mask mandates, individual school districts still have mandates.

The ab
sence of state mask rules has not meant a full return to pre-pandemic “normal” at school in most places.

 Poem:

We
 all want the same,
to go back to normality,
but like this claim,
that's still not the reality.

The majority of st
ates,
do not have statewide
 school mask mandates.
However,
 individual school districts abide
since they still hav
e mandates.

If mask rules evaporated,
that doesn't mean
normality would be stated
in most schools scene.


 Cla
im: Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president.

 Label: false
 Summary Explan
ation:

Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report receiving any donations from the Ukrainian governm
ent or Ukrainian nationals. Those donations would have been illegal.
A spokesperson for Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a
2015 Wall Street Journal graphic that has been frequently misrepresented online. The chart shows donations to the Clinto
n Foundation between 1999 and 2014 by the nationality of the individuals who made them; it does not say anything about d
onations to the foundation by foreign governments.
 The Clinton Foundation said it has never received donations from Uk
raine’s government.
 Poem:

In 2016, Hillary ran for president,
No reports of donations from Ukraine were evident.
Those donations would’ve been illegal,
Truthful reports would’ve been a miracle.
Graphics misrepresented,
Can affect
one’s reputation,
Clinton Foundation received individual donations
Never from Ukraine’s government,
That was an incid
ent.


 Claim:
The second booster has eight strains of HIV.

Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

 The ingr
edients of COVID-19 vaccines are published and do not include HIV.
 The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses
. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booster, has the same ingredients. 

 Poem:

Every fo
od has recipes,
precious holy grails,
Vaccines fight enemies,
who run off with their tails.

You don't change instr
uctions,
just because the dose is new.
We already made the introductions,
why would HIV be in queue?


 Claim:
Sa
ys President Donald Trump started a trade war that led to a surge in farm bankruptcies.

Label: half-true
 Summary Ex
planation:

Farmers were particularly hard hit by retaliatory tariffs imposed on the U.S. after Trump slapped tariffs
on China, Canada, Mexico and other countries in 2018 and 2019.
Family farm bankruptcies rose from 498 in 2018 to 595 in
 2019.
But farm bankruptcies have been rising each year since 2014.
And experts say the trade wars were just one facto
r driving the increase, along with low commodity prices and natural disasters.

 Poem:

Trump’s trade war led to a surge in farm bankruptcies,
The president’s trade war was just one factor,
But natural disasters and low commodity prices were also contributing factors.
Trump’s trade war led to a surge in farm bankruptcies,
The president’s trade war was just one factor,
But natural disasters and low commodity prices were also contributing factors.
