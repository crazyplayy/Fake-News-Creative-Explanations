Write me a poem for a given summary taking into account the claim and the label

 Claim: The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.
 Label: true
 Summary Explanation:

When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the United States has made progress, decreasing emissions 8.2% from 2010 to 2019.
 Among other
top emitters, Brazil made the most progress for that time period, with an emission decrease of 31.3%, but is now on the rise.
 But China and India saw major increases, of 25.4% and 36.6% respectively.
 Poem:

Co2, our little “Frienemy”,
you and the other greenhouse gases
need to leave, desperately!

The US set an example for once,
decreasing their emissions 8.2%
Brazil follows their example, but are struggling with the maintenance,
while China and India counter the occident.


 Claim:
The New York City Police Department arrested a 9-year-old because she didn’t have a vaccine card in the museum.

Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

 The 9-year-old was not arrested. She was escorted to the police station in a separate car from those who were arrested — a group which included her mother — and cared for by police officers until her mother was released.

The adults were arrested and charged with trespassing because they would not leave the museum after it closed.

 Poem:

Kids like to fool around
making jokes and pranks,
but they are not robbing banks
in a museum, goons ain't found.

This kid was escorted
to the police station,
there she was supported
and cared with attention.

She ended up there,
because mom was in a group
that police arrested fair.
The museum floor needs to be swoop
Time's over for photos and stare.

COVID-19 or card vaccine,
have no part in this.
Manipulation is no sin,
but trespassing is.


 Claim:
The second booster has eight strains of HIV.

Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

 The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are published and do not include HIV.
 The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booster, has the same ingredients. 

 Poem:

Every food has recipes,
precious holy grails,
Vaccines fight enemies,
who run off with their tails.

You don't change instructions,
just because the dose is new.
We already made the introductions,
why would HIV be in queue?


 Claim: Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun
 Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

Harvard researchers proposed a small-scale experiment that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. The experiment would measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology.
The experiment is funded in part through Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, and Bill Gates is among the donors to that program.
The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked.
 Poem:

yeah is hot,
glaciers are no longer in stock,
Bill Gates a solution tried to find,
but block only works on intagram, bear this in mind.

Now, the true story,
Bill, you don´t deserver the glory!
Havard was the one, the original author
You only gave them money and they took the offer.


 Claim: Says Joe Biden risks war with Russia because Vladimir Putin doesn’t “believe in transgender rights.“
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance said the State Department’s focus on transgender rights is inflaming the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.
Russia has placed as many as 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders.
Russia has said Ukraine’s ties to NATO are a key threat to Russia’s national security.
 Poem:

Nato is a threat for Putin,
 almost as transgenders are for JD Vance.
150,000 troops near the borders?
it’s fair to assume one in charge has a disorder.
Transgender or cisgender,
doesn’t define an offender.
 Biden claims Ukraine’s safety,
Putin’s heart only knows obscurity.


 Claim: The war in Ukraine is “scripted and staged.”
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

News reports, testimonies of citizens-turned-fighters, and a swift global response all fly in the face of baseless claims that Russia’s war on Ukraine is “staged.”
 Poem:

Open your eyes,
There’s no place like home.
Ukraine cries,
Russia lies,
Citizens wish to roam.
The inexperienced fighters blood spills like cherry wine,
“scripted and staged” scream hypocrisy,
We want Putin to resign
And give them a real democracy.



Claim:
In Chicago, Covid-19 actually LOWERED the death rate.

Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

A Facebook post shared over 2,000 times claimed that COVID-19 lowered the death rate in Chicago.
But an analysis of cases from the Cook County Medical Examiner suggests the opposite.
Deaths in Chicago increased in March 2020 compared to previous years, despite a decline in murders.
