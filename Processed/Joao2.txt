Claim:  There will be several thousand dollars in payments going to families with six-figure incomes who’ve had no income interruption whatsoever.  
Label: true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/21/pat-toomey/fact-checking-pat-toomeys-claim-families-six-figur/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Sen. Pat Toomey this week criticized President Joe Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, 
saying the direct payments Biden wants to send Americans are poorly targeted to those most in need.
Married couples making up to $150,000 annually would qualify for $2,800 in new payments, 
on top of the $1,200 they should have received this month from the relief package then-President Donald Trump signed into law late last year.
Together, those payments would total $2,000 per person — the target Democrats in Congress set, Trump made a late and unsuccessful push for,
and that Biden is now pursuing from the White House.
 
Poem: 
Biden wants to relief the american pockets.
though it might end up on already filled ones.
Married couples get the benefits
and the ones who need it wont get the funds.

Claim:  Kennedy Center, PBS donated to Democrats after getting COVID-19 stimulus money.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/22/facebook-posts/no-kennedy-center-and-pbs-didnt-pay-covid-19-kickb/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The Kennedy Center and a nonprofit that funds PBS received money from the $2 trillion federal stimulus law in response to the coronavirus.
Both Kennedy and PBS are nonprofits that are prohibited by law from making political donations. Federal election records show they have not made any such donations.
 
Poem: 
Covid left Culture collapsing,
so the government wanted to help out.
Republicans thought it was money laundering,
but the fund's destination left no doubt.

Both Kennedy Center and PBS are non-profit,
and the democrats didn´t profit from it.

Claim:  Video suggests Dr. Anthony Fauci said vaccines don’t protect against COVID-19.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/08/instagram-posts/misleading-video-suggests-dr-anthony-fauci-said-va/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
  The video shows real clips of Dr. Anthony Fauci, but misleading voiceovers have been added.
 Some confusion stems from Fauci’s distinction between the disease, COVID-19, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the disease.
 Research shows that the COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting the disease, 
but it is still unclear whether or not the vaccines will prevent people from becoming infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and transmitting it to others.
 
Poem: 
Don´t let the voiceovers get you mislead,
Dr. Fauci has been very clear.
The vaccines don't seem to stop the spread,
They just help you not getting sick, so don´t be in fear.

Claim:  The coronavirus has made it to Mississippi and the lady that caught it wasn’t around nobody with it which means it is airborne. 
That means if the wind blows it your direction you’ll have it also.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/03/facebook-posts/there-are-no-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-mississip/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 According to the CDC and Mississippi, there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state.
Researchers believe the disease is mainly spread person to person.
It has been hypothesized that the disease is airborne, but not documented.
 
Poem: 
Fortunately, covid doesn´t have wings,
but maybe the girl that supposedly got infected has,
because there were no cases in the Missisipi surroundings,
so where did this rumour fly from? why all this mess?

Claim:  Mask mandates on children lead to learning loss that harms early childhood development.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/19/scott-fitzgerald/lawmakers-claim-mask-mandates-harm-early-childhood/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Public health officials pointed out the article cited as support was “not a study but an opinion paper.”
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
limited available data indicates “no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children.”
 
Poem: 
Yes, children are sick of masks, as we all are,
but it doesn't mean they learn better without them.
Maybe next time before you cause such mayhem,
check if any study supports what you stated so far.
