 POLITIFACT CLIMATE CHANGE CLAIMS

-------------------------

Claim: Since 2000, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy have been spraying the entire United States sky with the toxic brew of chemicals and other biologic agents.
Label: Pants on fire!
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/02/facebook-posts/claim-us-government-spraying-toxic-brew-chemicals-/

Summary:
So-called “chemtrails” are not real, according to atmospheric chemists and geochemists. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it is not aware of any deliberate release of chemicals or biological agents into the atmosphere, and the U.S. Air Force says the theory is a hoax. 

Poem:
The decade began 
and so, their work on the US land,
spreading througth the sky like bumblebees,
their toxic chemicals and other biologic agents polen,
in a gentle breeze.

But don't worry about the next showers, 
nothing is going to happen to the flowers,
just remember to wear sunscreen,
was all just a big lie,
our atmosphere is squeaky clean!

Claim: Bill Gates hatches 'horribly stupid' plan to block out the sun
Label: False
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/feb/25/facebook-posts/claim-bill-gates-scheming-block-sun-wrong/

Summary:
Harvard researchers proposed a small-scale experiment that would spray aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect some sunlight back into space, a technology aimed at minimizing global warming. The experiment would measure the risks and effectiveness of the technology.

The experiment is funded in part through Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, and Bill Gates is among the donors to that program.

The claim first surfaced in 2021 and has been previously debunked.

Poem:
yeah is hot,
glaciers are no longer in stock,
Bill Gates a solution tried to find,
but block only works on intagram, bear this in mind.

Now, hear this story,
Bill didn't deserve the glory!
Havard was the one, the original author
He only gave them money and they took the offer.

However,
None of this is true.
Just another claim, out of the debunk queue.

Claim: FDA approval means nothing when you realize the FDA also approves pesticides in our food!
Label: Mostly False
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/27/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claim-about-fdas-role-approving-pest/

Summary:
The EPA sets limits on pesticide residue in food, while the FDA monitors the food supply and enforces the limits.

The Pfizer vaccine was approved after meeting the FDA’s standards for vaccine safety.

Poem:
Our bodies are prestine,
you should be carefull with the drugs you take in.
If of vaccines you are scared
the ones approved by FDA got you spared.

Yes, we ingest some pesticides,
but responsibility comes from two sides.
FDA takes care of our bodies,
by enforcing their safe quantities.

Claim: Within two years, there were two 500-year (storm) events” in Wisconsin.
Label: Mostly True
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/30/tammy-baldwin/wisconsin-has-seen-more-two-500-year-storm-events-/

Summary:
Wisconsin’s northern most counties were pummeled by storms that rose to the level of 500-year events in 2016 and 2018 

But those storms weren’t the only events to rise to that level within the same period of time.

Poem:
They say:
"You should always respect the elders"
and the two 500-years storms didn´t come to play,
they made sure they would appear on the papers.

However, they weren´t the only presents,
so don’t let them steal the spotlight,
other "oldy-but-goldy" 500-year level events,
were everything but a delight.

Claim: The US has made strides in reducing carbon emissions that other parts of the world have not.
Label: True
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/mar/11/glenn-grothman/us-making-progress-cutting-greenhouse-gas-emission/

Summary:
When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the United States has made progress, decreasing emissions 8.2% from 2010 to 2019. 

Among other  top emitters, Brazil made the most progress for that time period, with an emission decrease of 31.3%, but is now on the rise. 

But China and India saw major increases, of 25.4% and 36.6% respectively.

Poem:

Co2, our little “Frienemy”,
you and the other greenhouse gases
need to leave, desperately!


The US set an example for once,
decreasing their emissions 8.2%
Brazil follows their example, but are struggling with the maintenance,
while China and India counter the occident.
