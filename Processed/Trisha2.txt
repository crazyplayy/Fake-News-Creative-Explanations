Claim:  Federal aid for state and local governments through a proposed coronavirus relief bill would amount to half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/07/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-compares-cost-state-and-local-aid-coronavir/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Pelosi said that state and local aid in the Democrats’ proposed coronavirus relief bill would cost half as much as the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill.
State and local aid proposed by the Heroes Act would cost about half as much as the tax bill.
The statement doesn’t tell the full picture about what has caused increases in the national debt since 2017.
 
Poem: 
Democrats and Republicans,
What is said is mostly-true.
2017 tax bills was a fact,
The coronavirus relief bill is too.
Pelosi said the state helped,
Aid proposed by the Heroes Act.

Claim:  An email from Dr. Anthony Fauci shows everyone was lied to about wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jun/02/instagram-posts/post-using-old-fauci-email-falsely-claims-fauci-li/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The email from Fauci is from February 2020, when masks weren’t widely recommended to fight COVID-19. By April 2020, Fauci and other leading public health authorities recommended mask wearing.
 
Poem: 
Wear your mask
and stay safe.
It’s a simple task,
Have a little faith. 
It helps preventing the spread,
Fauci didn’t lie.
Help fight the virus instead,
or do you read the news high?
On health authorities you can rely.
On Feb 2020, they weren’t widely recommended,
By April 2020 that idea was suspended.

Claim:  Says Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said: Two doses of the vaccine offers very limited protection, if any.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/14/blog-posting/claim-about-pfizer-ceos-description-vaccine-leaves/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was speaking specifically about the omicron variant of COVID-19.
Bourla said that two vaccine doses offer very limited protection, if any, against the omicron variant. He said that three doses offer reasonable protection against hospitalization and deaths.
 
Poem: 
Two vaccines are better than one.
Do your job and vaccinate yourself,
Bourla is right so get it done.
Three doses help fight the variant,
Prevent hospitalization and deaths.

Summary Explanation: 
 The United States Supreme Court has not issued any ruling related to the COVID-19 vaccines or universal vaccinations, and there is currently no case on its docket involving challenges to vaccine mandates.
 
Poem: 
Breaking news,
False truths.
The Supreme Court has no issues,
those untruths need some reviews.
Universal vaccination is a yes,
There isn’t any ruling to the virus to cause stress.

Claim:  The coronavirus has made it to Mississippi and the lady that caught it wasn’t around nobody with it which means it is airborne. That means if the wind blows it your direction you’ll have it also.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/03/facebook-posts/there-are-no-confirmed-coronavirus-cases-mississip/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 According to the CDC and Mississippi, there are no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state.
Researchers believe the disease is mainly spread person to person.
It has been hypothesized that the disease is airborne, but not documented.
 
Poem:
You can’t confirm what’s not documented,
hypotheses are just that.
Let the wind blow in your face,
we don’t know where the virus is at. 
No confirmed cases in the state,
No proof meaning that is airborne.
To researches is mainly person to person,
Lack of reassurance can make us torn.

Claim:  White House, CDC, WHO and vaccine makers don’t require the COVID-19 vaccine for their workers.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/27/facebook-posts/covid-19-vaccine-mandated-several-other-organizati/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The COVID-19 vaccine has been mandated for all federal workers in the United States, including the White House, CDC and FDA. Makers of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. have also required their employees to get vaccinated.
Those who choose not to get the vaccine at any of the organizations must undergo regular testing for the virus.
The World Health Organization does not currently support vaccine mandates, advocating instead for information campaigns and vaccine accessibility.
 
Poem: 
White House, CDC and FDA equals vaccination.
Those who don’t care for vaccines, must care for testing.
The Who proclaims action,
Hence, the campaigns and accessibility they are investing.

Claim:  According to a recent CDC report, almost everyone — 85% — who got the coronavirus in July was wearing a mask, and they were infected anyway. So clearly (wearing a mask) doesn’t work the way they tell us it works.  
Label: false 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/15/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlson-distorts-new-cdc-report-makes-false/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The CDC report showed a correlation between testing positive for the coronavirus and going to bars and restaurants, where masks can’t be effectively worn. That counters Carlson’s claim that the July cases were “wearing a mask” and “infected anyway.”
The CDC report did not assess the impact of mask wearing on getting the coronavirus, and the study’s authors said the participants might not be representative of the U.S. The study dealt with 154 people who tested positive in July, not all the positive cases in July.
Masks are most effective as "source control," preventing infected people from transmitting the virus. Experts say they offer the wearer some — but not total — protection.
 
Poem: 
CDC reports and Carlson’s claim are not coherent.
The study was on a group of people, not everyone. So why be such an interferant? 
Masks help prevent and not end it.
In bars or restaurants you don’t wear one, 
making it easier to transmit.

Claim:  Clearly, the Obama administration did not leave any kind of game plan for something like this.  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/14/mitch-mcconnell/evidence-counters-mcconnell-claim-obama-team-left-/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Numerous Obama administration officials dismissed this statement. Ronald Klain, who was Obama’s Ebola response coordinator, tweeted a link to the plan.
Kayleigh McEnany, White House press secretary for President Donald Trump, held up a hard copy of the Obama “pandemic playbook” during a May 14 press availability on the White House lawn.
 
Poem: 
Obama did leave a plan,
Numerous administrations dismiss the statement.

Claim:  Says Joe Biden has issued more executive fiats than anyone in such a short period of time, ever, more than Obama, more than Trump, more than anyone.  
Label: true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/27/marco-rubio/how-joe-bidens-first-executive-orders-compare-past/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The total number of presidential directives signed by Biden during his first two days in office is greater than the number signed by Trump and Obama over the same period.
The available record before FDR isn’t complete enough to definitively say whether Rubio is also right about all presidents, but experts said it’s likely that his claim still holds.
It’s worth noting that Biden issued multiple orders directed at a specific issue that’s actively affecting the entire nation: the coronavirus pandemic.
 
Poem: 
Biden wins in executive orders.
More than Obama, Trump and maybe FDR himself. 
The pandemic got an hold on Biden,
making him issue every borders.

Claim:  Says Gov. Tony Evers is pushing firearm confiscation orders  
Label: pants-fire 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/25/facebook-posts/old-claim-tony-evers-and-gun-confiscation-wrong/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 A Facebook post finding new life amid the coronavirus outbreak says Evers is pushing gun confiscation, but the linked article is from April 2019.
At that time, Evers hadn’t proposed any such thing, and the article only details a call for red flag laws from the attorney general.
So what was wrong in 2019 is now both wrong and ridiculous.
 
Poem: 
News Feed lies happen every time.
No gun confiscation then, no gun confiscation now.
But, please, do! it’s worth every dime.
Such a red flag, how is this still allowed?

Claim:  Unvaccinated, you can get COVID and have over 99% chance of survival. Get vaccinated and you can still get COVID and will still have over 99% chance of survival.  
Label: barely-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/21/tomi-lahren/fact-checking-tomi-lahren-vaccines-and-covid-19-su/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 The overall COVID-19 case fatality rate in the U.S. is less than 2%, but experts say that’s not the same as a 99% chance of survival.
The post leaves out the fact that vaccination substantially reduces the risk of infection.
Reports indicate that more than 99% of recent COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. are among unvaccinated people.
 
Poem: 
99 percent? not quite.
It must be known the reduces of infection with vaccines. 
it’s not the 2 percent but the 99 death percent. 
Just vaccinate, by all means!

Claim:  In 2019, Republicans stripped $40 million from the budget for lead pipe replacement - because they thought it helped MKE too much.  
Label: mostly-true 
Source: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/dec/04/chris-larson/yes-gop-did-oppose-40-million-lead-pipe-replacemen/ 
 
Summary Explanation: 
 Gov. Tony Evers proposed $40 million in bonding that his administration estimated would be enough to replace 9 percent of the state's 170,000 lead service lines still in use.
One GOP legislative leader said replacing lead service lines would be too expensive and called for other options, including using drinking water filters in homes.
Another GOP lawmaker called for locally funded efforts because “a vast majority” of the funding would go to Milwaukee.
But the Republican lawmakers also cited other reasons for opposing the program.
