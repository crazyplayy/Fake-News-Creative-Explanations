Write me a poem for a given summary taking into account the claim and the label

 Claim: The war in Ukraine is “scripted and staged.”
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

News reports, testimonies of citizens-turned-fighters, and a swift global response all fly in the face of baseless claims that Russia’s war on Ukraine is “staged.”
 Poem:

Open your eyes,
There’s no place like home.
Ukraine cries,
Russia lies,
Citizens wish to roam.
The inexperienced fighters blood spills like cherry wine,
“scripted and staged” scream hypocrisy,
We want Putin to resign
And give them a real democracy.



Claim: Says Joe Biden risks war with Russia because Vladimir Putin doesn’t “believe in transgender rights.“
 Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance said the State Department’s focus on transgender rights is inflaming the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.
Russia has placed as many as 150,000 troops near Ukraine’s borders.
Russia has said Ukraine’s ties to NATO are a key threat to Russia’s national security.
 Poem:

Nato is a threat for Putin,
 almost as transgenders are for JD Vance.
150,000 troops near the borders?
it’s fair to assume one in charge has a disorder.
Transgender or cisgender,
doesn’t define an offender.
 Biden claims Ukraine’s safety,
Putin’s heart only knows obscurity.


 Claim:
The second booster has eight strains of HIV.

Label: pants-fire
 Summary Explanation:

 The ingredients of COVID-19 vaccines are published and do not include HIV.
 The vaccine ingredients do not change between doses. Each shot in the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine series, including the booster, has the same ingredients. 

 Poem:

Every food has recipes,
precious holy grails,
Vaccines fight enemies,
who run off with their tails.

You don't change instructions,
just because the dose is new.
We already made the introductions,
why would HIV be in queue?


 Claim:
Map shows states where all of the children… are back to living mask-free, normal lives.

Label: barely-true
 Summary Explanation:

 Though the majority of states do not have statewide school mask mandates, individual school districts still have mandates.

The absence of state mask rules has not meant a full return to pre-pandemic “normal” at school in most places.

 Poem:

We all want the same,
to go back to normality,
but like this claim,
that's still not the reality.

The majority of states,
do not have statewide
 school mask mandates.
However,
 individual school districts abide
since they still have mandates.

If mask rules evaporated,
that doesn't mean
normality would be stated
in most schools scene.


 Claim: Ukraine was the No. 1 donor to Hillary Clinton when she was running for president.

 Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign did not report receiving any donations from the Ukrainian government or Ukrainian nationals. Those donations would have been illegal.
A spokesperson for Marjorie Taylor Greene cited a 2015 Wall Street Journal graphic that has been frequently misrepresented online. The chart shows donations to the Clinton Foundation between 1999 and 2014 by the nationality of the individuals who made them; it does not say anything about donations to the foundation by foreign governments.
 The Clinton Foundation said it has never received donations from Ukraine’s government.
 Poem:

In 2016, Hillary ran for president,
No reports of donations from Ukraine were evident.
Those donations would’ve been illegal,
Truthful reports would’ve been a miracle.
Graphics misrepresented,
Can affect one’s reputation,
Clinton Foundation received individual donations
Never from Ukraine’s government,
That was an incident.


 Claim:
There is no such thing as a booster. There is a failed product that is sometimes used again in hopes of a different outcome.

Label: false
 Summary Explanation:

The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines is shown in the higher infection rates, spread, hospitalization and death among unvaccinated people.
It’s common to give boosters to maintain or lengthen the protection provided by an initial vaccination.
