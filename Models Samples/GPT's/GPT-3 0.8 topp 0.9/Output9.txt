 Gavin Newsom out of sight,
likely because he has Guillain-Barre syndrome?
That's quite the claim to make,
sounds more like a nightmare than a dream.

Unnamed sources and speculation,
is what this article is based on.
Conjecture and no medical explanation,
just trying to cause some commotion.

Newsom's spokesperson said
that the governor didn't have an adverse reaction,
Guillain-Barre syndrome?
I think not, just a case of fiction.
