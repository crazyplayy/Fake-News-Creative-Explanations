Man in the picture said he did not know how big is the fire,
But did you see the leaves?
They fell from the sky,
And the wind took them.

But, if it can successfully stop you from boardwalk,
it's still a small fry.

Once again discussing Donald Trump
Not sure if suffering from a bump
Stated that transportation hubs were being tested

In reality only screenings were carried out
For symptoms to flag
The only thing you need to worry is with jet-lag
So no miss-information needs to be spout.

Poem:
Open your eyes,
There’s no place like home.

“scripted and staged” scream hypocrisy,
