Republicans are mad as hell,
and they don't deserve any bows.
The Black Hawk Down incident wasn't such a big deal,
Since then masks are advisable.
Therefore the numbers don't bear any weight.

Claim:  Vitamin D, vitamin C, colloidal silver and black seed oil can kill the coronavirus.
Label: false
Summary Explanation:
While research has been mixed on the benefits of some supplements in treating or preventing COVID-19, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that they can kill the coronavirus.

Claim:  Says Sen. Thom Tillis doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.
Label: false
Summary Explanation:
A new television ad by Majority Forward PAC says U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) “doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.”

Warps the intentions
With no consistent mentions

Tillis gave his toughts
without any knots
He would be fine in the morning
wit at least a proper warning
