Remdesivir and the Ebola virus
Since being identified as a possible treatment for the Ebola virus, researchers around the world have been working hard to have their drug tested for Ebola and other deadly viruses. One of those researchers is David Oh, a professor of virology at the University of Florida. He is the lead author on the newly released paper on the drug (Remdesivir) that has allowed researchers to demonstrate it has the ability to fight the deadly Ebola virus.
Oh is one of six scientists involved in the collaboration, along with Dr Stephanie Seneff, Dr Claire Kirkland, Dr Jason Stites, Dr Sara Ridley, and Dr Daniela Schoenberg.
Oh's group was able to get early and ongoing data on the drug's ability to treat Ebola after successfully screening the drug in human cell lines.
In March, a group of researchers from Gilead (the company that developed Remdesivir) were in Liberia to conduct a clinical trial of the drug in people suffering from Ebola. The trial was halted due to vaccine shortages and concerns over whether the drug was safe enough to be released to the market.
That trial was not included in the paper referenced above, but researchers did note that some of the team had been involved in the earlier trials for the Ebola virus.
Oh said that the latter group had studied the trial in the US as well, and he was able to obtain data from that study.
Remdesivir, explained Oh
In the IFN-Î³ research paper, Oh explains that he and his colleagues have been trying to develop a non-reversible drug to treat Ebola. The researchers do not know if the drug can be used for more than one brief burst of treatment, but had been using it in patients for a couple of months and were preparing for a longer, longer trial when the Ebola outbreak began to escalate.
When Oh and his colleagues discovered that their drug is potentially effective and may be available sooner, they set out to see if they could find a way to test it.
Remdesivir works by blocking a protein that lets the virus out of cells in the body, and prevents it from being able to infect other cells. (A similar protein, called ZMapp , was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Ebola.)
Oh says that developing the drug took longer than they had hoped, but they had made some progress, and realized they could just share the data
