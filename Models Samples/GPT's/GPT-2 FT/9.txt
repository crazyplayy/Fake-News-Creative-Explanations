A new challenger approaches Forest
Claims are swift to ensnare
But, this time, it’s true.
Gavin didn't have a vaccine card
but, it wasn't what your're thinking,
it was more of a pity party.

He didn't have a vaccine card,
but, like potions from witchcraft,
there's no evidence of their results.

Newsom didn't have a vaccine card,
but, like potions from witchcraft,
there's no evidence of their results.

Claim:  Says Sen. Thom Tillis doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.
Label: false
Summary Explanation:
A new television ad by Majority Forward PAC says U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) “doesn’t think restaurant workers should have to wash their hands.”
The ad doesn't provide context for the comments, which Tillis made in 2015.
Tillis was making a point about regulations, not offering his opinion on whether workers should wash their hands.

Poem:
A simple twist of words
Not something we should look towards
Warps the intentions
With no consistent mentions

Tillis gave his toughts
without any knots
He would be fine in the morning
wit at least a proper warning

Claim:  Photo that shows COVID-19 test swabs labeled positive and negative proves that the tests are fixed.
Label: false
Summary Explanation:
An image that shows a COVID-19 testing kit with control swabs labeled “positive” and “negative” is legitimate, but it doesn’t prove that COVID-19 tests are pre-loaded with a result. The swabs are used for quality control to make sure the test is working correctly, not for patient testing.
Control materials are routinely included in medical testing kits to ensure that the tests are performing as expected and recording the correct results.

Poem:
All of these people with their misinformation
Must be the truth if its an image on the screen
Affecting our generation
They should stop making a scene

Professionals work hard
Safeguarding the test quality
So you dont have to be
