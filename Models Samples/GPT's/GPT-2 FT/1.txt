Summary Explanation:
The Pentagon and the NIH are not spending tax dollars to develop a vaccine to fight COVID-19.
The $34.5 million figure was used as an estimated cost per vaccine, and does not account for potential discounts or overlays.
The $6 million NIH grant was for direct payments to researchers, not to trial participants.

Poem:
The military attacks are a necessary evil,
but the virus still takes lives.
To stop you from infecting your loved ones,
the government prepares the vaccine.

That's the true,
and nothing but stupidity flows from it.

Claim:  White House, CDC, WHO and vaccine makers don’t require the COVID-19 vaccine for their workers.
Label: barely-true
Summary Explanation:
The COVID-19 vaccine has been mandated for all federal workers in the United States, including the White House, CDC and FDA. Makers of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. have also required their employees to get vaccinated.
Those who choose not to get the vaccine at any of the organizations must undergo regular testing for the virus.
The World Health Organization does not currently support vaccine mandates, advocating instead for information campaigns and vaccine accessibility.

Poem:
White House, CDC and FDA equals vaccination.
Those who don’t care for vaccines, must care for testing.
The WHO proclaims action,
Hence, the campaigns and accessibility they are investing.

Claim:  21% of people are having serious adverse events from (the Moderna) vaccine.

Poem:
With everything being so unstable
We must be careful of misinformation
Since its so propagable
And can light up a nation

False news have been spread
That one fifth of the Moderna vacinated were unwell
But the readers were misled
Only 1 in 200 that was the nutshell.
