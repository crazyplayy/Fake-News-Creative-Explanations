In early October,
Gov. Newsom was seen on the news,
“he has Guillain-Barre syndrome
caused by the COVID-19 shot.”

He cancelled his international trip
and didn’t go out in public,
until he was seen in public,
causing a stir. 

Gov. Newsom’s spokesperson said
he didn’t have an adverse reaction,
to the COVID-19 shot.

This was not a case,
of Guillain-Barre or Bell's palsy.
