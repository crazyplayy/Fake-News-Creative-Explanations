People in the United States have a low immune response to COVID-19 vaccine. 
Itâ€™s not just the immune response that is low,
the response to COVID-19 is more than
the number of people in the United States
who have a high immune response to COVID-19.
 
There is no evidence of a booster,
no evidence of the presence of a booster.
 
Poem: 
 The vaccine is effective against COVID-19. 
 The vaccine has a positive effect,
and the vaccine is effective against COVID-19.
