The state is sending out COVID-19 masks and pandemic-ready-to-wear masks to people who have no medical insurance.

The federal government has already sent out masks,
but they will not be sent to the sick. 
The COVID-19 vaccine is not a cure.

Poem: 
 No vaccine, no need to get on a plane to an emergency room.
